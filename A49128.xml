            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THEY who have a Reverence for the Holy Scripture will never be offended to ſee the number of the Champions of it encreaſe. 'Tis known that in the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Ages, when Religion was conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually attacqu'd, the Church was never diſguſted at the Apologies which the Chriſtians ſo frequently ſet forth. All thoſe that knew how to write, made it a part of their Duty to uphold Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. And there is no queſtion but that this was one of the moſt Potent means that Providence made uſe of, to advance the Triumphs of the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt. We are in an Age wherein the Scripture is diſhonoured, ſometimes after one manner, ſometimes after another: So that I cannot believe when Liberti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſm exerts it ſelf ſo boldly, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians will grow weary of ſeeing the Number of Apologiſts increaſe, who take upon them to defend that Scripture which made them Chriſtians.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:98516:7"/>
            <p>We dare not preſume to ſay, that all who have ſhaken the Authority of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture were profeſt Libertines, in regard that ſome Perſons of worth have upheld Propoſitions, which being carry'd a little too far, do great miſchief to that Book, for which in other reſpects they declare that they have an eſteem even to Veneration. 'Tis not poſſible to dive into the ſecret intentions of Authors, ſo as to know whether it be out of Impudence, or through a hankering after Libertiniſm, that they ſuffer theſe bold and dangerous ſtroaks to eſcape their Pens. The Libertine counterfeits himſelf ſometimes to be Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thodox, and a lover of Truth; and he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes his doubts with a ſeeming Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity, and vigorouſly aſſerts the Truth for fear of being ſuſpected. Sometimes alſo a faithful diſciple of the Truth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes himſelf in a feeble and trembling manner; and by his doubts and ſcruples gives an advantage to his Enemies. God alone knows the bottom of the Heart, and it is our Duty to leave it to him to decide the intentions of Authors; and to endeavour to defend the Truth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all manner of Onſets, on what ſide ſoever they are made.</p>
            <pb n="3" facs="tcp:98516:7"/>
            <p>There appear'd within theſe few Years a certain Treatiſe which attacqu'd the inſpiration of the Sacred Scripture. I ſhall not go about to inform my ſelf of the real Deſign which the Author had in compoſing a Work ſo injurious to Scripture; but I thought it neceſſary to prevent the evil Conſequences of ſuch a dangerous Book. Monſieur <hi>Witſius</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Lowth,</hi> a Divine of <hi>Oxford,</hi> Father <hi>Simon,</hi> and Father <hi>Le Vaſſour</hi> have ſet forth Anſwers to it which I have read. But in regard it was their only Deſign to trace their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary ſtep by ſtep, and not to handle this matter throughly; there is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſtill room left for a new manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. The Engliſh Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed in my Opinion has gone ſomewhat farther than the reſt; but I ſhall take the liberty to ſay, that he might have built the Inſpiration of the Holy Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings upon better foundations: that he has not ſo ſufficiently explained the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of it as he might have done, and that he has ventur'd to advance ſome things, which in my judgment, need a great deal of ſoftning. I hope he will be pleas'd to pardon me the Expreſſion, without which I could not be able to juſtifie my De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98516:8"/>of writing after him. In his Preface he acknowledges that the matter is nice and new; and after he has beſought the Readers not to cenſure him, as if he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to betray the cauſe which he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fends, he invites them to uphold it themſelves. According to this Invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I ſhall make ſome ſteps in order to it. If my Example ſhould excite ſome other more Learned Pen to write upon the ſame Subject, the Publick will be oblig'd to me for it. I ſhall be well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with my weak endeavours, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded they may give occaſion to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing any Treatiſe, that ſhall maintain the Inſpiration of the Holy Writings, as effectually as the truth of them hath been aſſerted.</p>
            <p>It will be found that I have tied my ſelf to conſider only the Writings of the New Teſtament: there was no medling with the Books of the Old Teſtament, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out cutting out too much work for my ſelf; in a time when the Public receives not well any but ſmall Treatiſes, eſpecially in matter of Divinity. Therefore, that I might accommodate my ſelf to the Palate of the Age, I was enforc'd to ſhorten my Subject. After I had taken this Reſolution, it was no difficult thing for
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:98516:8"/>me to chuſe which of the two Parts of Scripture it behov'd me to handle: So that I determind in favour of the New Teſtament; as being that Part upon which there has leaſt been ſaid. We have ſeveral Books in defence of the Inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Prophets and their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, becauſe they have been ſo often attacqu'd. But the Writers of the New Teſtament having peaceably enjoy'd the Honour pay'd them by the uninterrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed belief of their Inſpiration, Authors have not made it ſo much their Buſineſs to examine the nature of it; or if any Libertine has attempted to conteſt it with them, they have altogether relied upon the belief which the Church has had of it from time to time.</p>
            <p>Beſides this I may ſay, that by main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the New Teſtament I defend the Old: The Apoſtles have given ſuch honourable Teſtimonials of the Writings of the Prophets, that no Man can bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter maintain their honour than by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrating that Men inſpir'd by the Holy Ghoſt, have given Teſtimony to them.</p>
            <p>But the chief Reaſon which made me chuſe to defend the Writings of the New Teſtament is this; becauſe it is
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98516:9"/>properly the Book that makes us Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. It is our Duty indeed to read the Writings of the Prophets: there are to be ſeen thoſe Oracles, the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment of which is of glorious Conſequence to the Goſpel; there we are inform'd of a great number of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, wherein God appears magnificent in his Works; and thence may be drawn Inſtructions effectual for the Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Heart: <hi>all theſe things were written for our Inſtruction:</hi> but ſtill a Chriſtian muſt chiefly repair to the Writings to the New Covenant: there it is, that he ought to be moſt intent and ſtedfaſt: from thence it is, that he is chiefly oblig'd to receive his Faith and his Inſtructions, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to put himſelf into a ſtate of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. The New Teſtament is that Book which God deliver'd as a Legacy to Mankind, in theſe later times. 'Tis our Duty to cheriſh, as much as in us lies, the Reſpect which is due to that Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Book; and to prevent it from being reckoned in the Catalogue of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Writings; for fear the Religion which it teaches us, ſhould be look'd upon as a Piece of Human Invention?</p>

                  <p>The State and Importance of the Queſtion, and Diviſion of the Work.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT being my deſign to treat of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the Sacred Books of the New Teſtament, I cannot forbear ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly to ſet down the ſtate of the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion. Which being done, it will be found that all my Arguments aim at the ſame Mark; and that I have made it my buſineſs not to amuſe my Reader with any unprofitable Digreſſion.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place then, the Reader is to be admoniſh'd that the Diſpute is not here, which are Canonical Books, and which Apocryphal. We ſuppoſe that thoſe with whom we Contend, agree that there is no contradiction to be made againſt the Canonical Authority of the New Teſtament, according as we enjoy it at this day; but that thoſe Sacred Books were actually written or dictated by the
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:98516:10"/>Authors, whoſe Names are affixed to 'em. 'Tis agreed that theſe Holy Men both ſaw and heard the matters of Fact which they relate, and which they have written with extraordinary Fidelity and Sincerity. Which being granted, the Work begun is already in ſo great a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs, that there is no need at all of entring into the diſcuſſion of ſeveral Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties which concern the Queſtion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the Apocryphal Books. By this means alſo we are freed from the trouble of proving that the Sacred Books were written by Men who were Witneſſes of all the matters of Fact which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the Hiſtory of Jeſus Chriſt, or who themſelves wrought great Miracles, by which it appear'd that their Miſſion was Celeſtial. In a word, we are agreed upon the truth of theſe Books; ſo that nothing remains farther to be known, but whither they are inſpir'd. The Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and the Inſpiration make two diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>Queſtions,</hi> of which the firſt is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided: the Sacred Books of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament are ſtedfaſtly and undeniably true; at leaſt ſo far as concerns Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Things. The main diſpute is, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they are inſpir'd or no? So that there are ſome who let 'em alone with the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being true, but raviſh from them that of Inſpiration. 'Tis againſt theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>novators that I undertake the defence of the New Teſtament, of which I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:98516:10"/>alike, and equally aſſert both the Inſpiration and the Truth, even to the meaneſt Circumſtances.</p>
               <p>I could wiſh with all my heart, that I might be able to handle this Queſtion without chuſing any certain Adverſary. My aim was to examine this important Matter, without having any particular Author in view. But I found that the Error which I oppoſe, is ſo little known, that if they did not ſee it ſupported by ſome one or other, Men would believe I broached ſome Chimera of my own, for the exerciſe of my Fancy. Beſides, that the State of a Queſtion is never better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, then when it is taken out of ſome Book, wherein it has been already diſcuſs'd.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, <hi>M. N.</hi> Author of a Treatiſe publiſhed in <hi>Holland,</hi> preſented himſelf to my thoughts. I know no body that has more formally aſſail'd the Inſpiration of the Sacred Books of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Spinoſa</hi> led the way of the ſame Undertaking; but there was little heed given to that Author, becauſe all Men knew he had no Religion; and that moreover the obſcurity and negligence that appear in all his Works, have ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred them leſs formidable; for that ſuch Adverſaries are not much to be fear'd. But <hi>M. N.</hi> has given a more ſubtle and more dangerous Air to <hi>Spinoſa</hi>'s Notions and has digeſted them into a Syſtem, of

                  <item>2. <hi>In regard we have no Writings that ever Jeſus Chriſt himſelf wrote, we ought to believe what his Apoſtles have deliver'd to us concerning his Life and Doctrine, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God has given us his Teſtimonial of of them by means of the Miracles which he wrought in their Favour, and for that they have ſeal'd the Truth with their own Blood. It might be that in ſome Circumſtance of little Importance, they might relate ſome things not altogether ſo exactly as they paſt; but there is no reaſon that they ſhould agree preciſely in every thing to the Minuteſt Tittle.</hi>

                     </note> 
                     <hi>there are the ſame Doctrines there, which we find in the Evangeliſts; and the Apoſtles frequently aſſure us that they learnt them from Jeſus Chriſt. There are others which the Apoſtles utter of their own Heads, or which they infer from the Old Teſtament by divers Conſequences. We muſt believe the firſt for the ſame reaſon, that we ought to admit the Goſpels; that is to ſay, becauſe
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98516:11"/>of the Authority of Chriſt, who preached them to the Jews. We muſt admit the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, becauſe they contain nothing but what is moſt conformable to the Doctrines of Jeſus Chriſt, or which is not founded upon good ſence. We muſt alſo obſerve, that in regard they had not extraordinary Inſpiration to write their Epiſtles, they intermix ſeveral things that relate to their own Deſigns, and their particular Affairs, wherein it behoves us to be careful how we ſearch for Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries. Such are the Salutations at the end of the Epiſtles; St.</hi> Paul<hi>'s Orders to</hi> Timothy <hi>to take</hi> Mark <hi>along with him in his return to him: the Advice which he gave him to drink Wine ſparingly for his Stomach's ſake, and by reaſon of his frequent Diſtempers.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. <hi>There are ſeveral Prophecies ſcatter'd up and down in thoſe Epiſtles, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocalyps is abſolutely Prophetical. It behoves us to give Credit to theſe Revelations, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it was God who ſent them immediately to his Apoſtles.

               <p>After <hi>M. N</hi> has Epitomiz'd his Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem, he believes he has levell'd the way to Heaven,<note place="margin">

There is
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98516:12"/>that Inſpiration attributed to the Apoſtles, which they never pretended to have, and of which there is not any footſtep to be ſeen in their Writings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is only an applauding of himſelf: but I hope, the Author will meet with but few Men that judge as he does, of his new Theology. For ſo far is it from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing advantageous to Chriſtianity, that it is evident, and very evident too, that it ſets it upon the brink of a Precipice. We underſtand from a Friend of <hi>M. N</hi>'s, that this pretended Diſcovery has been look'd upon by ſeveral, as a<note n="*" place="margin">Defence of the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, <hi>&amp;c. P.</hi> 218.</note> Step that leads di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly to <hi>Deiſm;</hi> and the Author likewiſe is accus'd of favouring that abominable Opinion.</p>
               <p>'Tis not for me to judge of Monſieur <hi>N</hi>'s Intention; I know not whether he inclines toward <hi>Deiſm</hi> or no; beſides that I am willing to believe he does not; for why ſhould I attribute to an Author a Sentiment which he ſeems to deteſt; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially when a man is brought in queſtion who conceals himſelf, and who is not exactly known but only by venting his Opinions among us. I keep cloſe to his Writing. That gives me ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to ſay, that if he be not a <hi>Deiſt,</hi> he has done the <hi>Deiſts</hi> a very great kindneſs, as alſo all thoſe Libertines that could wiſh there were no Chriſtian Religion at all. They find very near what they look for in the New Syſtem, which delivers them
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98516:12"/>out of ſeveral ſtreights, and which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces Chriſtianity to nothing, or within a little of nothing. Is not this to favour <hi>Deiſm?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Since I am now upon the Point of the weight of this new Religion, the Vanity of which I ſhall in the Series of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe endeavour to ſhew; I muſt needs ſay, that a man may obſerve how that this new Religion allows the Chriſtians almoſt nothing of Inſpir'd: It ſuppoſes indeed that Jeſus Chriſt was infallible; but that ſignifies little, becauſe Jeſus Chriſt does not ſpeak to us either <hi>viva voce,</hi> or in writing. We muſt have recourſe to the Evangeliſts who were perſons of Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, and who have faithfully related to us what they both ſaw and heard. Some Body perhaps will add, that they have been good men who have left behind them in their Hiſtories ſeveral marks of their Simplicity; their Logick was falſe, they had not very good Memories, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all their Sincerity, ſo that they have aſſuredly but marr'd the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of their Maſter. We muſt acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that theſe Suppoſitions which agree very well with <hi>M. N</hi>'s Syſtem, create very great Scruples about the Goſpels. Beſides, they open a paſſage for ſeveral Niceties, that may be very inconvenient for Chriſtians that are deſirous to ground their Faith upon that part of the New Teſtament.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:98516:13"/>
               <p>What ſay they of thoſe other Writings which Providence has joyn'd to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpels? They are Works entirely Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, except the Apocalyps, to which they pay the Honour of Believing that it is abſolutely Prophetic. In the other Books they alſo diſcern ſome glimmerings of Light, ſome Prophetic Flights. Were it not for that, they are to be look'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as no other than little Books of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, or as ſhort Commentaries upon the Goſpel, in the Compoſition of which, the Holy Ghoſt never in any manner of way concern'd himſelf. When men are arriv'd at ſuch a Point, as to put aſide the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, S. <hi>James,</hi> S. <hi>Peter,</hi> S. <hi>John,</hi> and S. <hi>Jude</hi> muſt be look'd upon as Doctors that only explain Religion as well as they can: they muſt be only ſimple Artiſts who, without E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation or Learning, took all their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from their Piety, after they had run through a ſlender Courſe in Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy with Jeſus Chriſt. As for S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who had ſomething a better Education than the reſt, they will ſay he had this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advantage, that he was not an Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as they were, of the Principal mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact in the Goſpel, and that what he learnt from Revelation could not be ſo evident, as if like his Companions, he had ſeen and felt. It will be ſaid, that at moſt, he underſtood but as much as they did, and that he ought not to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98516:13"/>but in ſuch Parts where he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms the Hiſtory of the Goſpel. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in regard S. <hi>Paul</hi> does not pretend to the Office of an Hiſtorian, he is not to be credited but in ſome few Places. His Principal Character is that of a Doctor, who explains and argues. Upon thoſe occaſions, that is to ſay, quite through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all his Epiſtles, it ſhall be lawful to appeal from S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the Tribunal of Human Logic: Since that Apoſtle is to be look'd upon as no other than a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of good ability to hold an Argument, ſeeing he was no way inſpir'd. If ſuch a Syſtem ſhould get footing in the World, what would remain of Inſpir'd among Chriſtians? Very little: for by that means they take from us three fourth parts of the New Teſtament. There would no longer be one Book of it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd: it might indeed contain ſomething inſpir'd; but it would be no more inſpir'd in the compoſition of it, than any other Book, wherein an ordinary Author ſhould have inſerted Doctrines which Heaven had formerly reveal'd. For as thoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted Doctrines would not make the Book to be inſpir'd, ſo neither would ſome Oracles ſcatter'd here and there in the New Teſtament, appropriate Inſpiration to that Book. From whence I conclude, that when the Primitive and the New Chriſtians profeſs'd to believe that the Sacred Books of the New Teſtament
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98516:14"/>were inſpir'd, they never pretended bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to ſay, that the Apoſtles knew by In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration certain things which they had inſerted therein, but that it was their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, that the Book it ſelf, or to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain my ſelf more clearly, the Compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Book was the work of the Holy Ghoſt. This is a Reflection which I deſire the Reader to remember, when I come to diſcourſe of the Inſpiration of the Sacred Books in Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
               <p>In that ſence that <hi>M. N.</hi> would have us conceive what the New Teſtament is, it contains many human things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout which it is lawful to diſpute, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever S. <hi>Paul</hi> or any other Apoſtle ſhall hold any Argument which is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to <hi>M. N</hi>'s Principles, He ſhall anſwer, This is no more than the Argument of a mere man; let us ſee whether his Argument agrees with <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stotles</hi> Logic: If the Apoſtle has not follow'd the Rules of Conſequences, we may imagine that we have no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hearken to him. He's an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle — that's no matter — when an Apoſtle wanders out of the way, I am not bound to follow him. St. <hi>Paul</hi> applies to Jeſus Chriſt ſeveral Prophecies which the Holy Ghoſt appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priates to God in the Old Teſtament. And from thence a very ſtrong Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is drawn to prove the Divinity
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98516:14"/>of Jeſus Chriſt.<note place="margin">See the <hi>Racov. Cat. p.</hi> 47. If to two Interpretations of a very difficult place, we add a third.</note> The <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinians</hi> judge it a very hard matter to anſwer ſome parts of the firſt Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews.</hi> Henceforward there will be no longer any difficulty about any of all thoſe Oracles, if <hi>M. N.</hi> may be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved. There needs no more than to ſay, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> underſtood not the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of the Old Teſtament; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhall be lawful to examine that A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle by the Rules of Grammar and Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gic.

Several a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them have teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied a great reſpect for the Scripture at the ſame time that they diſhonour it by wreſted Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations: they profeſs how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever to believe that it is the Work of God; that it is inſpir'd in all the parts of it; that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains no Contradiction, and that there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding from this Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, without endangering the Chriſtian Religion. Now while they hold ſuch Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:98516:15"/>as theſe, it is impoſſible but that the <hi>Socinians</hi> muſt meet with great difficulties in the Scripture. But if they embrace <hi>M. N</hi>'s Opinion, they will find a large Fountain of ready Anſwers; and in truth it may be ſaid, that there are no Errors which may not be upheld by this new Method.</p>
               <p>Though it ſhould be ſaid, that this new Method tends to annihilate the Uſe of the New Teſtament, and to bring men back to natural Reaſon, as the only Light which they ought to follow in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, it ſeems to me that they would ſay no more than what is juſt and right. 'Tis true, <hi>M. N.</hi>'s Method does not ſpeak altogether ſo plainly, but it aims that way.

Let us keep the middle way, without bringing back the Abuſes with which men at other times had loaded Religion: Let us leave it a Body, to the end it may prove a ſupport to our Souls.</p>
               <p>It may be ſeen by what I have ſaid, of what Conſequence it is, to oppoſe the Career of <hi>M. N</hi>'s Syſtem, and more and
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:98516:15"/>more to confirm and ſettle Chriſtians in their perſuaſion, that the Books of the New Teſtament were inſpir'd. This is that which I pretend to make out clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in this Treatiſe, which I divide into two parts. Firſt, I ſhall ſhew in Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral that the Sacred Books of the New Teſtament were inſpir'd; and while I demonſtrate what the nature of that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration is, I ſhall produce Principles, whereby to reſolve all difficulties that are already, or may be, rais'd upon this Subject.</p>
               <p>We have but two ſorts of Proofs to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie a Chriſtian about matters which have no dependance upon the firſt Principles of Reaſon: the unanimous conſent of thoſe Doctors that liv'd in the Primitive times of the Church; and the Holy Scripture when it ſpeaks after a plain and deciſive manner. Theſe are the two ſorts of Proofs which I ſhall make uſe of, to ſhew that the Sacred Books are inſpir'd.</p>
               <p>I begin with the Belief of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church, after I have given the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der two Admonitions; the one, that I do not undertake to drain all the Proofs that are to be found in this Fountain; it being my deſign to confine my ſelf to what may bring the matter to a point of Demonſtration, and to derive my Proofs from the firſt or moſt Primitive Ages of the Church.</p>
               <pb n="20" facs="tcp:98516:16"/>
               <p>My ſecond Advertiſement is, that as <hi>M. N.</hi> aſſails the Body of the Sacred Books of the New Teſtament in groſs, I am not bound to defend them otherwiſe than in the ſame manner. That Author believes, that they are no way inſpir'd, that is to ſay, that the Holy Ghoſt was never concern'd in the Compoſition of them. For the repelling of this At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacque, it is not requiſite to follow the Sacred Books one after another, by ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the Subject of every one of them, that they were effectually inſpir'd. I ſhall therefore conſider the ſeveral Sacred Books as one ſingle Book; and I ſhall produce to the advantage of all together, all the Teſtimonies which I ſhall find fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable to any one in particular. 'Tis according to this Method that <hi>M. N.</hi> at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacques them: for when he thought he had obſerv'd in any one of the Sacred Books any ſlip of human weakneſs, he infers from thence an Argument againſt all the reſt. Let him in like manner be pleas'd to permit me to extend to all the Sacred Books whatever I ſhall meet with advantageous to any one, which ought to be allow'd me ſo much the rather, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is not any one ſingle, where there is not ſomething to be met with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, which <hi>M. N.</hi> takes for a good Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. If only one of the Sacred Books proves to be inſpir'd, the Inſpiration of that ſingle Book ſecures the reſt from
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:98516:16"/>the Objection which are made againſt them.</p>
               <p>Though I ſpeak in this manner, 'tis not that I am in fear for any one Sacred Book of the New Teſtament: the whole is ſafe, if men will but take the pains to conſider the Teſtimonies of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church in favour of the Inſpiration of the Sacred Books; they will not find any one, for which there is not the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of the Ancients: or if any one be more remiſs than the reſt, that negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence will be repair'd by the General Proofs that relate to all the parts of the New Teſtament.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The firſt Proof of the Inſpiration of the Sacred Books of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, drawn from the manner after which the Ancients ſpeak of it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>'TIS known how the Chriſtians ſpeak at this day of the Holy Scripture of the New Teſtament. According to their Stile 'tis call'd <hi>The Scripture,</hi> by way of Excellency; the Sacred Oracles, the Word of God; when the Preacher takes his Text, he ſays, as it is written in the word of God; and the People for that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98516:17"/>Reaſon believe themſelves oblig'd to hearken with a devout Attention.</p>
               <p>This Language no way agrees with <hi>M. N</hi>'s Syſtem, who looks upon the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Books as a work purely Human, and wherein there are faults which he would not pardon <hi>Livy,</hi> or any other prophane Hiſtorian. Were I of this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors Opinion, I ſhould be dreadfully troubled to hear the Chriſtians ſpeak as they do of the Holy Scripture; I ſhould cry out Blaſphemy; I ſhould never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure that they ſhould ſay of the Voice of a mortal man, 'tis the Voice of God and not of man.</p>
               <p>'Tis to be ſuſpected that <hi>M. N.</hi> ſays to himſelf, that it is one of thoſe pieces of Superſtition which are ſo rooted in the minds of the People, that it is not ſafe to decry them. But let him think what he pleaſes, the language of the Chriſtians is the ſame at this day, as it has been all a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long: in that particular there has been no variation. In the pureſt Ages they expreſt themſelves in reference to the Scripture as we do now. I defie the moſt Zealous Diſciples of <hi>M. N.</hi> to deny it. They cannot do it without ſpeaking againſt their Conſciences; or without ſhewing that they are altogether ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to Antiquity.</p>
               <p>To fortifie this Proof which I draw from the Appellations that the Anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents gave the Scripture, I think my ſelf
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98516:17"/>bound to make two Obſervations. The firſt is, that the Language cannot proceed from any ſuperſtitious Aggravation. It was in uſe in the very firſt times when Chriſtians ſpoke according to the ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of their Hearts, and when they had no leaſure to corrupt the Truth by Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick or Superſtition. In that ſame Age of Innocence, they call'd the Writings of the New Teſtament <hi>the Oracles of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the Word of God, the Holy Scripture.</hi> Nor can this language be accus'd to have ſprung up from the Corruption of after Ages, when Superſtition extended her Empire. I love to ſpeak, as they ſpoke at a time when the Church was a Virgin; if I may be allow'd to make uſe of the words of an Ancient Author.</p>
               <p>My ſecond Obſervation is this; that the Ancients, when they thus expreſſed themſelves, honoured the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as the New Teſtament had ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured the Ancient. I explain my ſelf thus; when the Old Teſtament is cited by the Apoſtles, they uſually call it the <hi>Scripture,</hi> without any addition; that is, the Scripture by way of Excellency; as when St. <hi>Paul,</hi> ſpeaking of an Oracle dictated by the Mouth of God himſelf, ſays, <hi>For what ſaith the Scripture,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 4.30.</note> 
                  <hi>caſt out the Bondwoman and her Son.</hi> And in another place,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.8.</note> 
                  <hi>And the Scripture foreſeeing that God would juſtifie the Heathen through faith, preached before the Goſpel unto</hi> Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:98516:18"/>ſaying, <hi>In thee ſhall all Nations be bleſſed.</hi> I made choice of theſe two Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages on purpoſe, wherein St. <hi>Paul</hi> cites certain Oracles, that <hi>M. N.</hi> would not himſelf deny, but that it was God who ſpake them. The Apoſtle calls them <hi>Scripture.</hi> As he phraſes it, <hi>The Scripture ſaith this,</hi> or <hi>God ſpoke This,</hi> comes all to one ſence This is ſo true, that having ſaid to the <hi>Romans,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Rom. 11.32.</note> 
                  <hi>That God had concluded them all in unbelief, that he might have mercy upon all:</hi> He ſpeaks the ſame thing to the <hi>Galathians</hi> in theſe words,<note place="margin">Gal. 3.22.</note> 
                  <hi>But the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture has concluded all under ſin,</hi> &amp;c. By which it appears that the <hi>Voice of God,</hi> and Scripture ſignifie the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>Thus then I argue upon the whole. The Apoſtles when they cited the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of the Old Teſtament, comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them all under the Name of <hi>Scripture,</hi> as if they would have ſaid, the Scripture of God. Now I find that immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Apoſtles, the Saints alſo quoted the Writings of the Apoſtles under the Name of <hi>Scripture:</hi> they have paid the ſame Honour to the Writings of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, as the Apoſtles did to the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. Have I not reaſon then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from thence, that it was the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Saints of the Primitive Church, that the Writings of the Apoſtles were no leſs the Scripture of God, than the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Writings wherein are recorded the Oracles of God?</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>The ſecond Proof, drawn from hence, that the Ancients have equall'd the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Apoſtles to the Oracles of the Old Teſtament.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IF what <hi>M. N.</hi> has aſſerted touching the writings of the Prophets were examined according to the Belief which the Primitive Church had of them, it would be ſoon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd that this New Syſtem is not to be maintained by dint of Argument. The Proofs of which are every where to be found: For the Primitive Writers of the Chriſtian Religion, being obliged to fetch from the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic writings their Arguments to convince the <hi>Jews,</hi> or to confirm the Chriſtians who acknowledged their Authority, this was the reaſon that they had frequent occaſion to ſpeak of the Inſpiration of thoſe Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. So that we plainly ſee, that they are hardly ever cited by the Ancients without ſome Elogie drawn from the Sanctity of their Original. Sometimes 'tis the VVord of God, ſometimes 'tis the Holy Scripture, ſometimes the Oracles of the Holy Ghoſt, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Scripture divinely inſpired. VVhen the Primitive Chriſtians quoted any paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage of the Old Teſtament, it was as they phraſed it the <hi>Mouth of the Lord that ſpoke.</hi>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:98516:19"/>But I do not ſpeak this to divert me from al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging ſome Proofs.</p>

                  <hi>Clemens Romanus</hi> who, as 'tis well known was contemporary with the Apoſtles, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Prophets, ſays, <hi>That the Miniſters of the Grace of God, inſtigated by the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, ſpoke of Repentance.</hi> A little after that-reciting a Maxim drawn from the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, he aſſures us, that 'twas no more than what the Holy Spirit recommended to us.<note place="margin">Quod vaticinantes non alio, quam verbo divino af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flati agantur, vos quoque ipſos dicturos reor.

                  <p>The third Proof drawn from the Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which the Ancients made between the Canonical and Apocryphal Books.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THis Diſtinction takes place in reſpect of both Teſtaments. There are join'd to the Canonical Books of the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſeveral Pieces purely Human, as the Books of <hi>Tobit, Judith, Baruc, Macabee</hi>'s, &amp;c. which are call'd by the name of <hi>Apocrypha.</hi> A word, of which the true Original is very uncertain. But whether it ſignifie conceal'd or obſcure, or whether it have any other ſenſe, certain it is that thoſe Books which are added to the Scripture, though they are not of divine Authority, are call'd <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crypha.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If the Books which are added to the Old Teſtament are not admitted to be Canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal, 'tis not becauſe they are defective in their matter. There are ſome of them whoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is ſound, and their Inſtructions pure, ſo that there has been no ſcruple made to read them publickly in the Church. I dare preſume to ſay there is ſuch a Portion of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocryphal Books which is more Inſtructive and more edifying, than ſuch a portion of books we call Canonical. Wherefore then are they rejected as Apocryphal? I know
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:98516:20"/>very well that ſeveral Marks of human Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty are to be diſcover'd in them; but the chief Ground of their being rejected is, becauſe they are Books which the Holy Ghoſt has not inſpir'd, the Finger of God appears not in them: the good things which are there to be found, flow not immediately from the Spring. Moreover we have reaſon to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min and ſuſpect them, becauſe they are not recommended to us by Perſons actuated by the infallible Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>This Reaſon is expreſs'd by the Ancients in other terms: for they ſay, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cryphal Books added to the Old Teſtament, want Canonical Authority, becauſe they were written by perſons who were no Prophets, and who lived after <hi>Malachi,</hi> the laſt of the Prophets. Wherein they followed <hi>Joſephus,</hi> who has deriv'd from thence the grand Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the difference which we ought to make between the Canonical Books and the <hi>Apocryphal.</hi> The words of the Author are ſo remarkable as not to be omitted.<note place="margin">Anſwer to <hi>Appion.</hi> l. 1. c. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>There can be nothing more certain, than the Writings au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriz'd among us; becauſe they cannot be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to any Contradiction; in regard that there is nothing approv'd but what the Prophets wrote ſome Ages ago; according to the purity of Truth, by the Inſpiration and Agitation of the Spirit of God.</hi>

               <p>VVhat I have ſaid in reſpect of the Old Teſtament, takes place in relation to the New. Several Books of Piety were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd in the Primitive Church; the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors were Perſons of Worth, and the Books were ſo uſeful, that the Reading of them was not only recommended to private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, but they made no ſcruple to read them in publick. For example, the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle of Saint <hi>Clement</hi> had the ſame Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour. VVherefore was it that thoſe Books were not put into the number of Canonical; that is to ſay, of thoſe Books that are the conſtant Rule of our Faith and Manners? It was not always becauſe they were in ſome things erroneous, but by reaſon they were not inſpir'd by the Holy Ghoſt: that was ſufficient to hinder them from being received for Canonical. The Queſtion that was put, when there was a Diſpute about any Book of which they doubted, was to know, whether or no it were written by a Perſon inſpired. Thence it came to paſs, that in the Hiſtory of <hi>Euſebius</hi> we find that <hi>Dionyſius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing his Sentence upon the <hi>Apocalyps,</hi> ſaid, that he acknowledged it to be the

               <p>WE may draw a very ſtrong Argument to prove that the Primitive Church believ'd that the Sacred Books of the New Teſtament were inſpired, from the Honour and Reverence which they paid them. I ſhall begin with that Holy awe which kept the Ancients from attempting any alterations in the Sacred Writings.<note place="margin">Addenti aut d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </note> It was a piece of raſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Sacriledge to adulterate them either by adding or diminiſhing. They were laden with <hi>Anathemas</hi> who were ſo bold as to lay their mending Hands upon thoſe Sacred VVritings.</p>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:98516:22"/>
               <p>We find in the Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory that the Heretics who denied the Divinity of our Lord, had the confidence to falſifie the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, to accommodate the Text to their O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinions. Upon which an Author of the Primitive Ages ſays, that it was not likely that the Heretics were ignorant how crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal an Enterprize of that nature was; <hi>For,</hi> ſays he,<note place="margin">Quantae porro au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daciae ſit ejuſmodi facinus ne ipſos quidem ignorare credibile eſt, aut enim ſacras ſcripturas à ſpiritu ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cto dictatas eſſe non credunt, ac proinde infideles ſunt, aut ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met ipſo ſpiritu ſancto ſapientiores eſſe exiſtimant; ac proinde quid aliud ſunt quam Demoniaci. <hi>Euſeb. h. e. l. 5. c.</hi> ult.</note> 
                  <hi>either they believe not that the Sacred Scriptures were dictated by the Holy Ghoſt; and ſo are Infidels; or they imagine themſelves to be wiſer than the Holy Ghoſt, and then what are they other then</hi> Demoniacs.</p>
               <p>They had an inviolable Veneration for the Sacred Scripture. <hi>Tatianus,</hi> for having only preſumed to put the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul</hi> into more elegant Language, incurred the Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, which may be ſeen in the Hiſtorian laſt cited.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Euſeb.</hi> l. 4.29.</note> If the Church were ſo jealous of the words of the Scripture, we may eaſily judge of the Indignation of the Chriſtians when they ſaw that any body durſt preſume to violate the Text it ſelf, either by addition or diminution.</p>
               <p>'Tis clear, that the Chriſtians would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have been ſo ſenſible of injury done to the Scripture, if they had not believed it to be the work of the Holy Spirit. Some ſmall frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Piety affixed to human Works would never have been a crime of Sacriledge. For
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98516:22"/>example, I ſee not what great harm it could be, to ſow to S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon,</hi> ſome little Diſcourſe upon that Indulgence, which is due from Chriſtian Maſters to their Servants, were it true, that the Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon</hi> is a Peice, wherein the Holy Spirit had no Share. 'Tis true, there may be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſaid, in diſlike of ſuch an Act, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard that Sincerity requires, that other Mens Works ſhould be let alone in their natural Dreſs. Nevertheleſs the Miſcarriage de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves not to be treated with the Penalties of Sacrilege: there is no reaſon to make ſuch a noiſe about it, as the Primitive Chriſtians did upon the Alterations that were made in the Writings of the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>Nothing more clearly ſhews the Opinion which the Ancients had of the Inſpiration of the Sacred Books, than the Honor which they paid 'em in looking upon 'em as Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign Decrees in Matters of Religion. For which Reaſon it was, that in ſeveral Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils they were plac'd upon a Throne, as they would have ſeated Jeſus Chriſt himſelf had he come viſibly to preſide in thoſe Holy Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. There was the ſame Honor paid to his Word, as they would have done to his Perſon. Which clearly ſhews with what an Eye of Veneration they look'd upon the Sacred Writings of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>This Honor alſo no leſs viſibly appears in the uſe which the Ancients made of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture to confirm the Faith of the Chriſtians. The Doctors of the Primitive Church allow
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:98516:23"/>a Sovereign Rank to the New Teſtament There is no longer any Heſitation, after the Voice of theſe Oracles has been once heard. Theſe are the <hi>Urims</hi> and <hi>Thummims</hi> of the New Covenant; after they once had ſeen their Deciſion, it was a Crime to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal.</p>
               <p>When we ſeriouſly conſider, that this is a Submiſſion and Compliance in Religion it ſelf, we ought to acknowledge, that this Honor was not paid to the Sacred Books, but becauſe they were, or at leaſt becauſe they were thought to be the Books of God, who is the only Lord of the Conſcience. And the Truth of this Reflection will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to, whenever it ſhall be call'd to mind, that we ſpeak of a time when the Chriſtians perfectly underſtood this privilege of the Almighty. They were very nice in this particular. Wherefore did they not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey thoſe Emperors that oppos'd the Courſe of Chriſtianity? It was the Lord had ſpoken. Wherefore did they not believe ſo many Philoſophers whoſe Example and Illuſions ſo ſtrongly ſupported Paganiſm? It was the Lord had ſaid it. Wherefore did they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake the Synagogue, that Synagogue which Divine Mercy had appointed to be the Guardian of the ancient Oracles? It was the Lord had ſpoken. The Scripture of the New Teſtament was more powerful than the Emperors, and triumph'd over the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation which the great Doctors had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd ſo long in all the Schools of the World. The Reaſon is, becauſe that in compariſon
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:98516:23"/>of God, Man is nothing: when God ſpeaks, no Body elſe is to be heard. Therefore the Chriſtians being convinced that the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſpoke in the Writings of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, they yielded with an awful Submiſſion to the Deciſions which they found therein.</p>
               <p>This was never contradicted by Hereticks; they durſt not appeal from the Words of an Apoſtle, becauſe they were perſuaded, that they were the Words of the Holy Spirit. The Method which they uſually made uſe of to avoid the Weight of that Authority was to mutilate the Scriptures, or to corrupt the Senſe by wreſted Explanations. But when it could be prov'd, that ſuch a Writing was Apoſtolical, or that ſuch a Senſe was the meaning of the Apoſtle, the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate Hereticks would ſubmit, at leaſt they had nothing to ſay. It is needleſs to cite Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors upon a Subject for which Proofs may be found almoſt in every Page of the Writings of the Primitive Church. More<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over there have been ſo many Occaſions to ſhew, that ſhe has always look'd upon the Scripture as the Rule of Faith, that theſe Proofs are become common. There needs no more for a Man to do, but caſt his Eye upon our Books of Controverſie, to ſee what have been the Opinions of the Fathers upon this Subject.</p>

<pb n="42" facs="tcp:98516:27"/>Conduct of it may ſeem to be obſcure. <hi>So neither is any thing abstracted from the Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Scripture diffus'd through every part of it, becauſe that in every particular word our Imbecility cannot reach the hidden Splendour of the Doctrine that lies latent, in an ordinary and ſeemingly contemptible Phraſe, for we have that Treaſure in Earthern Veſſels, to the end the Exu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berance and Excellency of the Power of God might ſhine forth. Origen</hi> expreſſed himſelf ſo vehemently, that he declares, that the ſmalleſt Letter of the Scripture was placed there by the Divine Wiſdom, and that for that Reaſon it was perhaps that our Lord and Saviour ſaid, that the leaſt <hi>Iota</hi> of it ſhould not paſs away. <hi>Exquiſitiſſima cura &amp; ſtudio Spiritus Sanctus per Miniſtros Verbi illa ſubjecit, ne unquam nos latere poſſet ratio ſecun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum quam Divina Sapientia omnem Scripturam Divinitus datam, vel ad uſque unam Literulam attigit; &amp; propterea forſan ſervator, Iota, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quit, unum, vel Apex unus, &amp;c.</hi> After this, <hi>Origen</hi> ſhews, that as the Care of God ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd in the ſmalleſt Inſects, and the Seeds of the ſmalleſt Plants, in like manner we ought to believe, that the Holy Ghoſt has di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpers'd the Traces of his Wiſdom in every Letter of the Scripture.

                  <hi>Thus you ſee that the moſt able and ſubtle Interpreters of Scripture which Chriſtian Antiquity produced, have been of the ſame O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion as my ſelf:</hi> that is to ſay, as it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent by ſome Lines before, <hi>that they did not acknowledge any Inſpiration that continually and ſtedfaſtly impuls'd the Apoſtles to write what they wrote.</hi> It might be thought that this Concluſion was the product of a croud of Citations; after which there was no que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to be made but that the Ancients were of <hi>M. N</hi>'s Opinion. But it was no ſmall wonder to us, that the beginning of the Concluſion ſhould be reduc'd to theſe two or three words; <hi>It behoves us to joyn with St.</hi> Jerome, Origen, <hi>from whom he had drawn this Opinion touching the Diſpenſation which he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98516:28"/>attributes to theſe two Apoſtles,</hi> and ſeveral o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Greek Fathers.</hi> Should I ſay, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther St. <hi>Jerome,</hi> nor <hi>Origen,</hi> nor any of the other <hi>Greek</hi> Fathers ever contradicted the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the Apoſtles, ſuch as we affirm it to be, permanent and conſtant, <hi>M. N.</hi> has an anſwer ready, and will tell us, that he did not cite thoſe Ancients, but to ſhew, how they believed that St. <hi>Peter</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made uſe of Diſpenſation at what time Saint <hi>Paul</hi> contradicted St <hi>Peter.</hi> Certain it is that no other uſe can be made of that Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; but it is placed ſo cunningly after theſe words, <hi>It appears from thence that they did not acknowledge a continual Inſpiration,</hi> &amp;c. That it is eaſie to be perceived that the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor had a deſire to dazzle thoſe people who have any reſpect for Antiquity, but who are not acquainted with it but at a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance.</p>
               <p>However, it is to be ſeen by the Paſſages which I have cited out of <hi>Origen,</hi> that he is poſitive in the Point of Inſpiration of the Sacred Books. Nor does St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſpeak leſs expreſly; neither ſhall I conſult any other Part but that which <hi>M. N.</hi> has marked out for me; <hi>See,</hi> ſays he, <hi>the Preface of St.</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rome <hi>to his Comment upon the Epiſtle to</hi> Phile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon. Would not any Man who read that Reference believe, that it would be infallibly found in that Preface, that St. <hi>Jerome</hi> proves by the little Things which are to be met with in Scripture, that he did not believe the Holy Ghoſt concern'd in the Compoſition of all the Sacred Books. I have read the
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:98516:29"/>Preface very ſeriouſly, and I am confident that <hi>M. N.</hi> has read it alſo; for the Perſons which he there mentions, ſpoke much after the rate as he does. Wherefore then had he not ſo much ſincerlty as to acknowledge, that the Objection drawn from the Minute things in Scripture (give me leave to make uſe of the expreſſion) is like the reſt in the mouths of thoſe Adverſaries which St. <hi>Jerome</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes to refute. He declares at firſt that he ſpeaks of thoſe who refuſed to admit the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Philemon,</hi> and who ſaid exactly the ſame thing as <hi>M. N.</hi> and <hi>Spinoſa</hi> ſay, <hi>Non ſemper Apoſtolum, nec omnia, Chriſto in ſe loquente, dixiſſe.</hi> They alledged what St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays of the Cloak which he left at <hi>Troas;</hi> that the Prophets were wont expreſly to tell the people when they ſpoke in the Name of the Lord, becauſe they were not always Prophets. Theſe are exactly <hi>M. N</hi>'s ſcruples. But St. <hi>Jerome</hi> ſupports them no manner of way; quite the contrary, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that they are in the wrong for not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting the Epiſtle to <hi>Philemon,</hi> under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that it contains ſeveral things of little moment, and makes uſe of a Compariſon which <hi>Origen</hi> has made uſe of upon the ſame Subject. <hi>If,</hi> ſays he, <hi>they have a mind to deny that the great and the little Things come from one and the ſame hand, then let them admit two Creators; one Creator of the Inſects, and another of Heaven and Earth.</hi> Is this any ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction for a Man that would favour the Opinion of <hi>M.

               <p>It ſeems by the Preface of St. <hi>Jerome</hi> upon <hi>Philemon,</hi> that from that very time, there have been anonymous Perſons who thought as <hi>M. N.</hi> does.

Thus it is, that the Fathers generally expreſs themſelves after the <hi>Nicene</hi> Council. But I have laid an Injunction upon my ſelf not to deſcend too low: and I have only ſpoken of <hi>Epiphanius,</hi> by reaſon of <hi>Aetius</hi> who profeſt the ſame Opinion with <hi>M. N.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor do I find that that ſame <hi>Arian</hi> was able, any more than his Diſciples to interrupt the Series of <hi>Tradition,</hi> or to hinder the common Belief of the Univerſal Church from being altogether for the Inſpiration of the Sacred Books of the New Teſtament. As for Saint
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:98516:30"/>
                  <hi>Jerom</hi>'s anonymous Perſons, and <hi>Epiphanias</hi>'s <hi>Anomeans.</hi> they make not a part of the Church conſiderable enough, for any man whatever to produce them as Teſtimonies. But in regard it has been all along my aim to confine my ſelf to the three firſt Ages of the Church, I ſhall ſay no more than this, that 'tis apparent that theſe Innovators who appear'd not till the Ages following, cannot hinder me from concluding, that I have on my ſide the Univerſal teſtimony of the Church truly Primitive.</p>
               <p>This Teſtimony is of great moment in the Minds of all men that conſider thoſe Ages to be the moſt pure, at what time they had things deliver'd to them as it were from the firſt hand. I know not what I ought to think of a Chriſtian who deſpiſes ſuch An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity. Such a Scorn may be excus'd in people who are ignorant of it, but when we find the learned neglecting a Teſtimony ſo authentick, 'tis a temptation to believe that either they have not well conſidered the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences which that Teſtimony has upon the Foundations of the Chriſtian Religion, or that elſe they would not be ſorry to ſee that Foundation ſhaken.</p>
               <p>It may be ſaid that the Fathers which we ſo highly extol, were guilty of divers Errors. I grant it; 'twas by the permiſſion of God, that by that means the Writings which he has ſolely abandon'd to human Wiſdom, ſhould be diſtinguiſh'd from thoſe which he infallibly directed by his Spirit. But we ought to know what thoſe Errors are, before
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:98516:31"/>we draw an argument againſt what the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers have ſaid for the Inſpiration of the Sacred Books. Firſt I obſerve that thoſe Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors are not univerſal among the Fathers: now that wherein they contradict themſelves can never be ſaid to be the unanimous Voice of Antiquity. This is the Character of the Errors with which the firſt Authors of Chriſtianity were upbraided. Some deviated after one manner, others after another: but they were not found in company under the ſame deviation. Such Errors have nothing common with the truths which they teach both conſtantly and without variation, of which nature is the Inſpiration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Books of the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>I add to this conſideration, that it is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to examine well the nature of the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of which the Fathers are accus'd, before an argument be rais'd from thence againſt their unanimous Teſtimonies for the inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Scripture. Sometimes they mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake in ſpeaking of ſomething to come which never was revealed to them; as when they diſcourſe with too much confidence, how near at hand the end of the World is. Sometimes they err in matters of Fact which they have admitted with too much Credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, as when they tell the Story of a Phoenix riſing again out of her aſhes. But nothing of all this does any injury to what they have averr'd touching the inſpiration of the Sacred Books. That is a Truth that marches ſtep by ſtep with the delivery it ſelf of thoſe Books. They were deliver'd from hand to hand with
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:98516:31"/>this Advertiſement, that they were inſpir'd by the Holy Ghoſt. It is as certain, that the Holy Ghoſt directed and order'd the Compoſition and ſtructure of the Goſpels, as that the Goſpels were written by St. <hi>Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> Saint <hi>Mark,</hi> Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> and Saint <hi>John.</hi> This is one of thoſe things that were eſſential to the Honour of the Sacred Books; and which were every day ſaid of them. So that 'twas impoſſible that this Tradition ſo lively and univerſal as it was, ſhould come from any other hand than the Apoſtles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who when they left their works be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind them, acknowledged they had been written by the enlivening inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt. This has no reſemblance in the leaſt with the ſtory of a Phoenix, nor with what the Fathers imagin'd about the end of the World, while they croſly interpreted the words of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>There is not any more plauſible Objection than that which may be drawn from the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Fathers upon the Verſion of the <hi>Septuagint. Juſtin Martyr, Ireneus,</hi> and <hi>Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> were of Opinion that thoſe Interpreters were guided by the Spirit of God. However at this day, many people believe that they were ſubject to Error, like the reſt of the Interpreters, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence left to themſelves. Upon which ſome may raiſe this argument: Since the Fathers were deceived in their Opinion touching the inſpiration of the <hi>Greek</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters of the Old Teſtament, the teſtimony which thoſe Fathers give in relation to the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98516:32"/>Apoſtolic Writings ought not to be ſo ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly urged: 'tis from thence to be ſeen that 'tis not an infallible Teſtimony. I have ſeveral things to obſerve, by way of ſolid anſwer to this Objection.</p>
               <p n="1">1. There are learned Men of the firſt Rank, who indeed maintain that the <hi>Seventy Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters</hi> were really guided by the Holy Spirit. It cannot be deny'd, but that it was by a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial direction of Providence, that the Sacred Books were tranſlated into a Language that was almoſt Univerſal. It was proper, that at a time when God would not be known but in a ſmall corner of the World, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Books ſhould be in <hi>Hebrew.</hi> But when Grace was ready to diſperſe them over the Earth, was it not convenient that the Books where God had revealed himſelf, ſhould be put into the moſt univerſal Language? That Tranſlation prepar'd the way for the <hi>Meſſiah:</hi> and the Apoſtles had the advantage of quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Verſion which the VVorld had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mir'd for a long time. This ſo well agrees with Gods deſign of calling all People to the knowledge of himſelf; that it cannot be deny'd, but that by his Providence he ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nag'd the opportunities which produc'd the Verſion of the <hi>Septuagint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No body can deny what I have ſaid; but ſeveral there are who go a great way far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and maintain, that the <hi>Greek</hi> Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters, were effectually inſpired. To prove this, they quote divers Authors. They pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that S. <hi>Jerome</hi> was the firſt, who ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventured to contradict that Tradition. After
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:98516:32"/>they had cited the Chriſtians to ſupport their Tenent, they ſearch for it in <hi>Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew,</hi>

'Tis for that reaſon 'tis believed he did not ſpeak all he thought of the Verſion of the <hi>Seventy:</hi> but that he inſinuates it ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently, when he writes that the High Prieſt, the Interpreters and the Magiſtrates of the <hi>Jews</hi> deſired that it might no longer be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to change the leaſt Tittle in that Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. If it be true that the Greek Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preters were particularly guided by the Holy Ghoſt, as ſeveral learned Men aſſert; 'tis
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98516:33"/>evident, that the Objection has no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I add to this that the Apoſtles, while they moſt commonly made uſe of the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the 70 Interpreters have in ſome meaſure rendred them Canonical, and that it is become a work of the Holy Ghoſt, at leaſt by way of approbation; which in ſome meaſure juſtifies what the Ancients have ſaid of it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. I grant that the Fathers who believed the inſpiration of the Interpreters were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd. But that Tradition not being to be compar'd in extent to that which I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged in favour of the inſpiration of the Apoſtolic Writings, there is no conſequence to be inferr'd from the one againſt the other: For the one, they own they only cite ſome of the Ancients contradicted by Saint <hi>Jerome</hi> whereas I have produced the unanimous Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony of Antiquity.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Let them but a litle examine the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the matter in Queſtion. The act of Inſpiration of the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpreters was an Act that happen'd, as they pretend, about three hundred Years before the Birth of Chriſt, and which was convey'd through the Channel of a <hi>Pagan</hi> and ſome <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo that it was no ſuch impoſſible thing but that the Primitive Fathers of the Church, over credulous in reference to that Verſion for which they had an eſteem, ſhould be deceiv'd in honouring it with a Celeſtial Original. But the inſpiration of the Sacred Books of the New Teſtament, is
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98516:33"/>quite of another nature: That was a matter of Fact, which the Ancients took, as I may ſo ſay from the Lips of the Apoſtles, and which was perpetuated by a Tradition re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated every day, and that too among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians remote one from the other. Since then there is ſo great a difference between theſe two matters of Fact, 'tis evidently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent, that though all the Fathers were in an Error when they ſpoke of the inſpiration of the <hi>Greek</hi> Interpreters, it cannot be thence concluded that they were miſtaken in the infallible Inſpiration which they adſcribe to the Apoſtolic Writings.</p>
               <p>By ſearching into the Objections againſt the Truth which I have proved; I imagin'd with my ſelf, that one might object an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Cuſtom of the Church to honour the Goſpels, by cauſing the People to hear them read ſtanding, whereas every body might ſit down at the reading of the Epiſtles. Does not this ſignifie, will ſome body ſay, that the Goſpels being full of things that iſſue im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from the Lips of our Saviour, it was ackowledged by that reverend Poſture, that they were look'd upon as infallible Oracles; but that there was not the ſame Veneration paid the Epiſtles, in regard they were deemed to be Pieces purely Human? However this Objection brings little advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to <hi>M. N</hi>'s Opinion, who denies the Goſpels to be any more inſpir'd than the Epiſtles. He believes the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Truth no otherwiſe than ordinary Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, and that the Apoſtles wrote their
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98516:34"/>Epiſtles no otherwiſe than like more Doctors, who utter what comes into their Fancies, in matters of Religion. According to this Idea, the Hiſtorian is no more conſidered than the Doctor; ſo that the Objection will not ſerve <hi>M. N</hi>'s turn. But if any other would make a Benefit of it, he ought to know that the Cuſtom which he lays hold of, is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſo ancient, nor ſo univerſal as may be imagin'd. Though, were it as ancient as the Apoſtles, or as univerſal as the Church, which it is not, there is no concluſion to be drawn from thence, that the Epiſtles are the works of Men. And to be convinced of this, there needs no more that to call to mind, that the Cuſtom in Diſpute, was taken from the Synagogue, where the Law and the Prophets were heard with diſtinguiſhing Marks of Veneration; not that they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved the Prophets were not inſpir'd, but they look'd upon the Prophets as only infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Commentators upon the Law, and thought that they were to pay a greater Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the Text than to the Commentary, to <hi>Moſes</hi> than the Prophets. A Cuſtom which afterwards ſlided I know not how from thence into the Chriſtian Church. By which they have in ſome meaſure advanced the Goſpels into the place of the Law, and the Apoſtles into the room of the Prophets; not that the Apoſtles were thought to be leſs inſpir'd than the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> but only to give the advantage of Honour to the Goſpels; whether it were becauſe the Goſpels, as I ſaid before, contain thoſe things that iſſued im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98516:34"/>from the Lips of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; or whether it were, as Cardinal <hi>Bona</hi> ſaid, to ſhew <hi>that we are or ought to be always ready to obey the Precepts that God has commanded us in his Goſpel.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein we begin to prove by the Books of the New Teſtament, that they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd, and particularly by the Intention which God had in giving them to the World.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Am entring into a ſort of Proof that more directly oppoſes the Syſtem of <hi>M. N.</hi> He pretends, that in the Writings of the New Teſtament, there is no Proof of their Inſpiration. We are going to ſhew the contrary in the Choice which I have made of thoſe Proofs. They are of two ſorts; General and Particular: The General are Six in Number; the Deſign of God in his Writings; the Manner of their Compoſition; the Nature of the Covenant, of which they are the Writings; the Privilege of their Authors; the Promiſe of Jeſus Chriſt; and the fulfilling of that Promiſe.</p>
               <p>Now to know by the Writings it ſelf of the New Teſtament, that it was inſpir'd, there needs no more than to conſider the Purpoſe of God in granting it to Men. If his Aim be ſuch as is not to be attain'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out inſpiring the Interpreters of his Will, 'tis clear that they were not wrote without the aſſiſtance of his Inſpiration.</p>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:98516:35"/>
               <p>Should I but go about to make a ſmall Incurſion into Antiquity, I might from thence produce ſeveral Teſtimonies which aſſure me, that the Deſign of the Almighty, in the Writings of the New Teſtament, was to ſupply the Abſence of the Apoſtles, and to lay us down a Rule, which might be, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Expreſſion of <hi>Ireneus,</hi> the Foundation and Pillar of our Faith. This is that which is prov'd by the expreſs De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the ancient Doctors, and by the conſtant Uſe which they have made of the Scripture. But I have ſaid enough upon this Subject already; and therefore it is my purpoſe now to fetch my Proofs from the Bottom of that Divine Scripture.</p>
               <p>I certainly perceive two Deſigns of the Almighty; the one is a particular Deſign with regard to certain perſons, at a certain time: the other has a Proſpect, in relation to all Men and all Times. The Traces of theſe two Deſigns appear in all the parts of Scripture. The Commencement and Birth of the Goſpels and Epiſtles was for the moſt part occaſional; if I may be permitted to uſe the Expreſſion: S. <hi>Luke</hi> declares, that the Number of Goſpels which ran about was the Occaſion of his. 'Tis alſo pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Hereſie that began to ſhew it ſelf in S. <hi>John</hi>'s time, oblig'd him to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pile his Goſpel, as a Rampart, to fortifie the Faith of the Chriſtians. The Occaſions which produced the moſt part of the other Writings of the New Teſtament, are ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified diſtinctly enough; or if there be any
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:98516:36"/>of which we know not the Occaſion of their Writing, it is not thence to be concluded, that there was no occaſion given for their being written in the Age whererein they were ſet forth: but Providence has permitted an Eclipſe of that Knowledge, which it deem'd not neceſſary for our Salvation. We may ſee that there is hardly any part of the New Teſtament, that has not ſome parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular and peculiar Occaſion.</p>
               <p>'Tis of no advantage to my Subject, to examine whether the Apoſtolick Writings had any need of being inſpir'd to fullfil the particular Purpoſes of the Almighty. I ſhall only ſay, that the Inſpiration of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures was nothing near ſo neceſſary in the Primitive Times, as it is at this day. When they for whoſe ſake the Scripture was firſt compil'd found not wherewithal therein to ſatisfie themſelves, they needed no more than to ask the Apoſtles, and to enjoy all the Advantages which the firſt Age afforded for their Inſtruction. But now that we have nothing more than the Scripture, there is an abſolute neceſſity, ſince it is the Pleaſure of God to inſtruct us ſolidly, that it ſhould be inſpir'd.</p>
               <p>I do not believe there is at this day any Chriſtian Society, which is not convinc'd, that beſides the particular Occaſions that have given Birth to the Scripture, God was alſo willing, in compoſing it, to take care of after Ages. The Chriſtian Religion is a Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Favour which God cauſes to glide along from one Age to another, for the Happineſs
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:98516:36"/>of Mankind. It will laſt as long as the World endures: Men will declare and publiſh the Death of our Lord and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, till he appears again in perſon. The Promiſe belongs to us and all thoſe that ſhall come after us, <hi>as many as the Lord ſhall call to himſelf.</hi> No Chriſtian makes any queſtion, but that the Chriſtian Religion will be the Obſervance of all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges: otherwiſe why ſhould he call himſelf a a Chriſtian?</p>
               <p>Having thus proved the Continuance of our Sacred Religion, would we know how God preſerves it, we ſee no other means by which he does it, than by the Scripture, which after it had ſerv'd for the Uſe of the Firſt Age, gives Light to us in our Turn, as it will enlighten our Poſterity.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. N.</hi> acknowledges, that indeed the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture is the means of the Propagation of our Faith, but he believes, that for that purpoſe it is enough, that the Sacred Authors have made a faithful Report of what they learn'd from our Lord, tho their Additions and their Commentaries are abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely the Growth of their own Heads. However, if Men would but conſider, they will find that God would but have badly put in execution the Deſign which he has laid of eſtabliſhing a ſolid Faith, had he follow'd the Syſtem which I oppoſe.</p>
               <p>You tell us, that the Sacred Writers have faithfully reported what they learn'd from our Lord and Saviour. This is certain, if you affirm that the Holy Ghoſt guided their
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98516:37"/>Pens. But if you believe, that they wrote of their own Heads, you deſtroy their Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. That they were honeſt and ſincere, I agree; but ſuch perſons may be deceiv'd. I cannot rely upon 'em, unleſs I believe that the Holy Ghoſt was their Guide in every Truth. I ſee in their Sacred Writings ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Arguments, and a great number of Applications of the Old Teſtament. If I believe that the Holy Ghoſt was their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructor, I willingly ſubmit to 'em, but with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch an aſſiſtance, I cannot repoſe upon Commentators, who, ſetting aſide the Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour of the Holy Ghoſt, were leſs learned, and of leſs Abilities than many Doctors at this day. Moreover, had the Apoſtles al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diſtinguiſh'd what they knew by Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, from what they ſpoke of their own Heads, there would be leſs difficulty in the thing: but they preſent us almoſt all the whole Bulk in a Mixture, where it is a hard matter to diſcern what is Divine from what is not. My Conſcience cannot be ſatisfied with this Method; I am always in doubt whether I ought to argue after the Apoſtles, or whether I ought to appeal from their Deciſions to my own Reaſon. I can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be able to ſtop the Progreſs of Error, if after I have found a Paſſage which utterly and clearly deſtroys it, it ſhall be reply'd upon me, this comes from the Apoſtle, not from God; and thus there will be never any thing of Certainty. But moſt aſſuredly God has not made Choice of a Means that authoriſes our Doubts, for a Rule of our
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98516:37"/>Faith. Of Neceſſity therefore all the Parts of Scripture muſt be divinely inſpir'd, to the end the Scripture may <hi>render the Man of God accompliſh'd in all good Works.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein the Inſpiration of the Sacred Books of the New Teſtament is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by the manner of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>It is a difficult Thing to conceive, that the Sacred Books of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould be inſpir'd by the Holy Ghoſt, and yet that there ſhould appear no Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps in it of that Inſpiration; and this is that which I deſign to examine. I do not pretend, by any means, to prove, that every Page or every Line of the Holy Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture carries imprinted in it a ſenſible Character of the Splendor of the Holy Ghoſt that inſpir'd it. Take the beſt Book, if you pull it to pieces, you leſſen the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of it. 'Tis only eſteemed for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Aſſemblage of Words and Things of which it is compos'd: After you have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd the Proportion and the Symmetry, you will no longer find what caus'd it to be admir'd. Let the whole Scripture be but duly conſider'd, and it will be found to be a Work worthy of Heaven. There are
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98516:38"/>ſome Peices of it without queſtion, which being conſidered apart, ceaſe not however to deſerve our Admiration. But there are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which being remov'd out of their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per place, will appear very common. Let us look upon the Scripture in that Point of Perfection, as the Holy Ghoſt repreſents it to us, and we muſt needs acknowledge it to be his Work.</p>
               <p>It were to be wiſh'd, ſome will ſay, that the Holy Ghoſt had manifeſted himſelf more diſtinctly in the Writings of the New Teſtament. How! would ye that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould not have ſpoken the Language of Men? I confeſs indeed, that he might have ſpoken the Language of the Third Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, but it would not have been intelligible to us, who are not there as yet. Since he ſpoke to Men, to the end they might un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand him, 'twas neceſſary he ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his Style to human Apprehenſion. He was oblig'd to take upon him our Manners, our Words, our Shape, and our Air to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert us. To that purpoſe he made choice of Men, made as we are, after they were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently inſtructed in what they had to ſay to us; and he was to guide their Pens for fear they ſhould make any falſe ſtep. Had the Holy Ghoſt either ſent an Angel, or form'd a Voice in the Air, to ſettle the Doctrine of Heaven, ſuch means had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear'd more extraordinary, but they were not fit for Inſtruction. It was the Wiſdom of God to prefer <hi>Uſeful</hi> before <hi>Miraculous.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:98516:38"/>
               <p>The only Difficulty is to know which way to find out, that they who wrote like other Men were guided by the Holy Ghoſt. There are two Ways whereby to attain to this Knowledge; the One is the Atteſtation of the Apoſtles ſtrengthened by the Proofs which they have given of their Sincerity: and by the Miracles by which they made it appear, that they were Men who were ſent from God. The other Way is to ſearch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Compoſition it ſelf of the Sacred Books for Proofs of their Inſpiration. As to the firſt way, 'tis not our Intention at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to call it in queſtion.</p>
               <p>As to the Second, I ſhall conclude in a few Words. 'Tis a ſtrange thing to conſider the various Oppoſitions of human Wit. This Book wherein ſome behold the Finger of God, by others is look'd upon as a Piece of human Workmanſhip. Let us impartially examine the Matter. The profane muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that they are prepoſſeſſed in their Judgments which they make of the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture: for when they read another Peice, that is but a little ſtudy'd according to the Rules of Art, they are charm'd with it; they cry 'tis all divine; they affirm, that there is nothing great without Inſpiration.<note place="margin">Nihil magnum ſine affla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tu divino.</note> But when they come to the Scripture, they are quite of another Opinion; they deſpiſe what they would have admir'd in another Book. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, it has ſo happen'd, that upon ſome Occaſions the Force of Truth has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted ſeveral Approbations in favour of <hi>Moſes,</hi> the Prophets and S. <hi>Paul.</hi> The
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98516:39"/>World has found that there was ſomething extraordinary in thoſe great Men. But if we would but ſearch into the Original of the Scripture without prepoſſeſſion, we ſhould ſoon confeſs, that it is a Work of Heaven. This does not appear perhaps upon the firſt Reading. Read it again, and the more you read that Book, the leſs you will be weary of reading it; nay, it will appear more lovely the laſt time than the firſt.</p>
               <p>Had I to do with Chriſtians only that with delight have read over and over again the New Teſtament, I would refer 'em to their own Experience, and ask 'em whether their Hearts ever found that Satisfaction in any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Book which they found in this. But it behoves us to ſpeak ſomething which may be more generally ſatisfactory. Was ever known a Doctrine more ſublime, or Inſtructions of a purer Extraction. 'Tis true, that there are in the World certain People who have ſo diſguis'd this Doctrine, as to make it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear low and mean. Now I conſider it ſuch as it is in it ſelf; in this Proſpect I dare ſay, that Men never ſaw any Book ſo much worthy of their Admiration.</p>
               <p>This Argument, is not proper but for perſons that have abſolutely declared them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the Chriſtian Religion. <hi>M. N.</hi> will ſay, that the Queſtion, whether it be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired or no, is not the Subject of the Diſpute. He grants that Jeſus Chriſt was divinely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd; and in regard it was by him, that his Evangeliſts and Apoſtles were inſtructed, 'tis clear that the Religion which they
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:98516:39"/>preach'd, bears the Character of its firſt Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, that the Queſtion between <hi>M. N.</hi> and my ſelf, chiefly concerns the Manner how they publiſh'd thoſe Truths which they learn'd from the Lord. Our Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor believes, that in that reſpect, they were left to their own Judgment, and that there is no neceſſity of admitting the Aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt into the Compoſition of their Writings. On the other ſide, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make it out in the Series of this Diſcourſe, that without that aſſiſtance the Scripture is of little uſe. Now as the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon which I inſiſt in this Chapter is drawn from a ſerious Inſpection into the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Books, I aſſert, that if they be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, it will appear that their Compoſition is not purely human. I ſhall not prove this Propoſition by heaping together the noble Paſſages that are to be found from time to time in the Writings of the Apoſtles; I only ask who theſe new Authors were, that ſpake ſo worthily of the Religion which they preach. We find among 'em <hi>Galileans,</hi> that is to ſay, home-bred ignorant People, born in a Country where there was nothing of Politeneſs; we find 'em to be Fiſhermen, that is to ſay, People by their Profeſſion rude and unpoliſh'd. By them, let us judge of the reſt, ſince 'tis agreed, that if any one of the Apoſtles were inſpir'd in Writing, the Queſtion is decided. Where was it then, that theſe Authors learn'd to write well? Let us grant, that their Writings are not ſo
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:98516:40"/>fine as the Books which the World eſteems. The Authors of thoſe Books had the Help both of Study and Art, which is all human. But where was it that the Sacred Authors learn'd their Manner of Writing?</p>
               <p>We find that the Queſtion is not whether the Writings of the Apoſtles are more elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent than thoſe which the World admires. Suppoſe an Equality as to that matter, that's nothing to my purpoſe: the Buſineſs is to know where the Apoſtles learn'd their Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of writing thoſe things which they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver. Upon the Day of the <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> they ſpoke new Languages, that other Men ſpoke. But the Miracle was this, that the Apoſtles ſpake Languages which they had never learn'd before. Some will ſay, tho to little purpoſe, where was the Miracle, ſeeing that others ſpoke as well as they? 'Tis true indeed, the Apoſtles write as other Men; but here is the Difference not to be conteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Apoſtles had never learn'd to write; and I think this may paſs for a good proof of the Inſpiration of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>

                  <hi>was given by Moſes, but Grace and Truth came by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> S. <hi>Paul</hi> inſiſts upon the ſame Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, in his Second Epiſtle to the <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians: But if the Goſpel be hid,</hi> ſays he,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.3, 6.</note> 
                  <hi>it is hid to thoſe that periſh.</hi> And he gives this Reaſon for it. <hi>For God,</hi> ſays he, <hi>who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhin'd in our Hearts, to give the Light of the Knowledge of the Glory of God, in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Theſe Expreſſions are very
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98516:41"/>clear, and make out as evidently as it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, the Inſpiration of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> It is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to bear it in remembrance; but I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt at preſent only upon the Advantage of the New Covenant, which is to be more full of Light and Clearneſs than the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</p>
               <p>This being granted, I conſider the Degrees of Light that enlighten'd the Old Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. I find that the Prophets, who were inſpir'd by the Holy Ghoſt, inſtructed the Ages they liv'd in; but they alſo tranſmitted that Inſpiration to the ſucceeding Ages by their Writings, which were conſulted with as much Religion, as they would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted their Authors had they been alive. Thoſe Sacred Monuments were read, as they would have hearken'd to the Prophets themſelves. The Mouth of God ſpake ſtill in their Writings. The Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> was of this Opinion, except, as it is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly thought, a Handful of Sadducees, who, the better to defend their Errors, entrench'd themſelves in the Pentateuch. However this does not hinder <hi>Joſephus</hi> from ſaying in general.<note place="margin">Anſwer to <hi>Ap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

                  <hi>Moreover, there can be nothing more certain, than the Writings authoriz'd among us, in regard they are not liable to any Contrariety, in regard there is nothing approv'd but what the Prophets wrote ſeveral Ages ſince, according to the Purity of Truth, by the Inſpiration, and by the Impulſe of the Spirit of God. Neither do we trouble our ſelves with infinite Numbers of Books that contradict one another, as having no more than Twenty two,</hi> &amp;c. And a little af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:98516:41"/>
                  <hi>We have ſo profound a Reſpect for theſe Books, that never any Body was ſo hardy as to undertake either to add or diminiſh, or alter the leaſt Tittle. We look upon 'em as Divine: we call 'em ſo: we profeſs to obſerve 'em inviolably, and joyfully to lay down our Lives, if there be occaſion, in defence of 'em.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing can more clearly expreſs the high Opinion which the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church had of the Sacred Books that compoſe the Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament. And <hi>Joſephus</hi> is more to be believ'd upon this Subject, than a modern Author, who tell us, that the Prophets had no other Aſſiſtance of the Holy Ghoſt, than a pious Diſpoſition which made 'em write like per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of Sincerity, but without any Prerogative of Infallibility. But this was not <hi>Joſephus</hi>'s Opinion; this was not the Belief of the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh</hi> Church; this was not the Judgment of S. <hi>Peter,</hi> who declares, that <hi>Holy Men of God ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nor is there any father doubt to be made of it after the Deciſion of St. <hi>Paul. The whole Scripture is divinely inſpir'd, and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table for Inſtruction.</hi> I ſhall not make any ſtop at the nice Cavil of <hi>Grotius,</hi> who would make S. <hi>Paul</hi> to ſay, <hi>The whole Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture which is divinely inſpired is profitable,</hi> &amp;c. The Anſwer of <hi>Theophilact</hi> is ſufficient. <hi>They are to know,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that the Apoſtle ſaid, thou haſt been bred up from thy Infancy in the Holy Scriptures.</hi> He ſays, <hi>All Scripture: what Scripture does he mean? The ſame of which he ſaid, that it was Sacred.</hi> It was in truth, in all the parts of Scripture, that <hi>Timothy</hi> had
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:98516:42"/>been inſtructed from his Infancy. St. <hi>Paul</hi> therefore exhorting him to perſevere in the things which he had learn'd, would not have argu'd rightly, if when he urg'd it as a motive for his perſeverance, that <hi>all Scripture</hi> was inſpir'd, he had not ſpoke of the whole Book which the <hi>Jews</hi> look'd upon to be all <hi>Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the Main, the obſervation of <hi>Grotius</hi> does my argument no harm, though it were well grounded; for the deſign of that Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is only to deprive the Hiſtorical Books of the Old Teſtament of the Honour of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration. He acknowledges in another place, that <hi>Moſes, Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> and <hi>Daniel</hi> were divinely Inſpired. So that according to <hi>Grotius</hi> the Jewiſh Church had Books wherein the Holy Ghoſt ſpake. Had they need of the Spirit of God, they found it in the writings of the Prophets: and this Light has conſtantly endur'd in all Ages of the Jewiſh Church, even in the later times, as corrupt as they were.</p>
               <p>Ought we not to have a Light at leaſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to it, under an Oeconomy, wherein it is agreed, that God has manifeſted himſelf with more advantage than under the Law? We have no longer any Apoſtles; there are no longer any men inſpir'd, if we have not writings which repair that loſs, by means of that Infallibility with which the Holy Ghoſt would have inveſted them. To whom is it not apparent, that our condition is worſe than that of the ancient <hi>Jews?</hi> The Day ſhin'd out to them, but it is Night with us.
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:98516:42"/>All the advantage is on the ſide of the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal poſterity of <hi>Abraham,</hi> even of that which is rejected.

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein the Inſpiration of the Books of the New Teſtament is made out by the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogatives of the Apoſtles.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THE beſt way which we have to know certainly whether the Chriſtian Church has not as great a ſhare of divine Illumination as the Jewiſh Church, is to ſee what ſort of Perſons the Authors of the New Teſtament were. The Jewiſh Church had Prophets and we have Apoſtles: our Books, except two or three which were made under the inſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Apoſtles, were written by the order and with the approbation of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. There needs no more than to ſee
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:98516:43"/>whether our Apoſtles were not equal in worth to the Prophets of the Old Teſtament. In the Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> I find them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualled together,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>C.</hi> 2. <hi>v.</hi> 20.</note> in the work of Salvation; <hi>being built upon the Foundation of the Apoſtles and Prophets.</hi> In this place to ſpeak of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality would be an injury to the Apoſtles, in regard that here they are named before the Prophets.</p>
               <p>Nor is it without good Ground that I make this obſervation, ſince St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom is to put the Apoſtles at the head of the Miniſters of the Chriſtian Church. She had alſo Prophets, and Prophets inſpir'd like thoſe of the Old Teſtament. Would you know which are the moſt Excellent, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles or the Prophets? There needs no more than to ſee what rank they hold in the Catalogue which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Grace.<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.28.</note> 
                  <hi>Firſt Apoſtles, ſecondarily Prophets, then Teachers.</hi> Beſides, that this is a Place where the Apoſtle is bound to mark out to every one his Station: Chance had no ſhare in Ranging them under that Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. So that we find that St. <hi>Paul</hi> obſerves the ſame Order in the ſequel of his Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. <hi>Are all Apoſtles?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.29.</note> 
                  <hi>are all Prophets? are all Teachers?</hi> In his Epiſtle to the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians</hi> the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> are ſet before the <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers;</hi> but he is conſtant in the precedency which he gives the Apoſtles before the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. He has appointed ſome for Apoſtles, and others for Prophets. Nevertheleſs, notwithſtanding his humility, he gives the firſt Place to his own Dignity: when he acted
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:98516:43"/>in his Apoſtleſhip he gave way to no Man. If we may believe him, the Apoſtles of the Chriſtian Church were more excellent than the Prophets.</p>
               <p>Nor do we too highly exalt the Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, by adding, that it included in it ſelf all the advantages affixed to the inferiour Degrees. The Apoſtles were Prophets and Teachers; they had the Gift of working Miracles, which the Holy Ghoſt divided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them. <hi>Had they all the Gift of Healing? Did they all ſpeak divers Languages? Did they all Interpret?</hi> No, but the Apoſtles did all this; the Grace of the Apoſtleſhip included all other Graces. We ought not ſlightly to paſs by the words of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> when deſigning to ſet forth, that ſubordination which Grace had eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in the Primitive Church by the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Gifts; he declares, <hi>that to every one is given the manifeſtation of the Holy Ghoſt, ſo far as is expedient.</hi> Though St. <hi>Paul</hi> had not ſaid it, 'tis a Truth which common Sence would have given us to underſtand. For do we not find that it is incumbent upon the wiſdom of God to order the Means accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Purpoſe which he propoſes to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Let us then ſay, that the Apoſtles had a meaſure of the Holy Ghoſt proportionable to the deſigns of the Apoſtleſhip. They had at leaſt as much of the Spirit of Truth, as the Prophets had received. We ſay, <hi>at leaſt;</hi> for in regard the Apoſtolic Writings were to be ſerviceable toward the edification of the Church at all times and in all places, 'tis
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:98516:44"/>clear that thoſe Writings wanted a more e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecial aſſiſtance than thoſe other, of which the primitive uſe was only for a particular Nation, and for a very limited time. But 'tis ſufficient for me to extend the force of my Argument ſo far, that the Prerogative ought at leaſt to be equal. If then the writings of the Prophets were inſpir'd, as I have prov'd, certainly the writings of the Apoſtles, who were the more excellent, ought <hi>à fortiore,</hi> to be inſpired.</p>
               <p>'Tis not any thing of perſonal Excellence which is the Buſineſs in diſpute; for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and Apoſtles are not to be here conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, but with reference to the Uſe that they were made for. The Prophets were not Prophets for themſelves,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.12.</note> 
                  <hi>unto whom it was revealed, that not unto themſelves, but un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us they did miniſter the Things,</hi> &amp;c. The Apoſtles were not Apoſtles for themſelves; but it was for our ſakes that they admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter'd. They are our Maſters, we are ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon their Writings. Let us compare the Prophets and the Apoſtles, we ſhall find, that as it is certain that the Apoſtles were much more excellent than the Prophets, 'twas re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite they ſhould have a more advantageous ſhare of the Holy Ghoſt. They ſtood in need of a lively and durable Light which was not to be extinguiſh'd by time, but to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten all Ages.</p>
               <p>I do not believe this argument is to be elu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with the leaſt Tittle of Solidity. Some will ſay, that we ought to look upon the Writings of the Prophets with a more awful
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:98516:44"/>reſpect, becauſe upon ſome occaſions we find that they ſpeak like Prophets, and as it were the immediate Embaſſadors of God. But this Conſideration brings no advantage to the writings of the Old Teſtament. For we ſee ſomething of the ſame nature in the greateſt part of thoſe of the New Teſtament; even in thoſe, wherein according to <hi>M. N.</hi> there are the feweſt of the inſpired Paſſages. I ſpeak of the Epiſtles of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> which he begins with a Preface wherein is to be ſeen, under what Quality he writes; <hi>Paul an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> He writes like an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, like a man inſpired by the Spirit of God; like a man ſet apart to preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel. The Title is ſufficient to ſhew that he wrote like an Apoſtle, and with all the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the Grace of the Apoſtleſhip. Infallibility was one of the dependencies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Grace: for the Holy Ghoſt conferr'd it upon every one ſo far as was expedient. Was it not expedient that the firſt Miniſters of the Goſpel ſhould be infallible, when they proclaimed ſuch Myſteries to the VVorld? It is viſible that the Grace of Infallibility was neceſſary in the exerciſe of the Apoſtleſhip. The Queſtion then returns to this? Did S. <hi>Paul</hi> exerciſe his Apoſtleſhip in writing? Did he make uſe of that Grace in his VVritings?</p>
               <p>We cannot have a better Teſtimony than himſelf, who tells us that he wrote as an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle of the Lord. By vertue of that Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter which he aſſumes in the Prefaces of his writings, he exacts from us our Belief of all that he ſays. To contradict him in any
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:98516:45"/>thing, is to diſhonour the Apoſtleſhip, and to offend the Holy Spirit who made the Apoſtles. From time to time St. <hi>Paul</hi> informs us, even in the body of his Epiſtles, that it is by ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the Grace of God which he has recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as an Apoſtle that he inſtructs his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders. <hi>For I ſay,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.3.</note> 
                  <hi>through the Grace given unto me, to every man among you,</hi> ſays he to the <hi>Romans.</hi> He lays his Foundation according to the Grace of God,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.10, 11.</note> and he builds upon that Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation according to the Grace which is given him; that Grace which he ſo frequently mentions with ſuch great Elogies. In the firſt Chapter of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans</hi> he calls it Grace by way of Excellency;<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.5.</note> 
                  <hi>By whom we have received Grace and Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip,</hi> &amp;c. In his Epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> he ſpeaks of this Grace with a greater emphaſis, <hi>whereof I was made a Miniſter, according to the gift of the Grace of God given unto me, by the effectual working of his power; to me is this Grace given,</hi> &amp;c. The Grace of the Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip was then a Gift of the firſt Degree; and according to that degree it was, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> both taught and wrote. But beſides the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony which St. <hi>Paul</hi> gives of himſelf, we have on his behalf the atteſtation of Saint <hi>Peter,</hi> who tells us that St. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the wiſdom which was given to him. This is a Talent which he had not hid in the Ground; he could not do it: I ſpeak thus, not only in reference to the probity of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> who had too much Sincerity to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe the Counſel of God; but becauſe the Counſel of God was ſuch, that the Goſpel
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:98516:45"/>ſhould be preſerv'd in its Purity, by the means of the Apoſtolick writings. This was the Buſineſs of the Almighty, nor could the Apoſtles but obey that Sovereign Order upon which depended the Salvation of the whole World. The Apoſtles wrote ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that wiſdom which God had im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to them: which clearly enough con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms their Inſpiration. Nor have the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetic Writings any ſtronger argument on their ſide.</p>

                  <hi>But the Comforter which is the Holy Ghoſt, whom the Father will ſend in my Name,</hi> ſaid Jeſus to his Apoſtles, <hi>he ſhall teach you all things, and bring all things to your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance whatſoever I have ſaid unto you.</hi> This Promiſe puts us in hopes of two things: the one is, that the Apoſtles ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed by the Holy Ghoſt in reference to their Apoſtleſhip: the ſecond is, that the Holy Spirit would bring diſtinctly to their
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:98516:46"/>Remembrance, whatever they had heard their Maſter ſay.</p>
               <p>VVe ought to obſerve that our Lord and Saviour makes this Promiſe at a time when he was deſirous to comfort his afflicted A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles.

This was a general Promiſe which diſſipated the diſquiet of thoſe Holy men.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Luke</hi> 12.11, 12.</note> They had been already aſſured that they ſhould never want words when they ſhould be called be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Tribunals. <hi>And when they bring you unto the Synogogues, and unto Magiſtrates and Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:98516:46"/>take ye no thought how or what thing ye ſhall anſwer, for the Holy Ghoſt ſhall teach you in the ſame hour what ye ſhall ſay.</hi> The Repetition of this Promiſe was very neceſſary, when Chriſt was ready to leave the World, and that the Apoſtles were upon the Point of being hauled before Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates. Nor was this the only occaſion wherein the Diſciples of the Lord had need of his aſſiſtance; he makes them a much lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger promiſe; and aſſures them that the Holy Ghoſt ſhall guide them in all truth, to the end they may fulfil the Functions of their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtleſhip.</p>
               <p>A Promiſe ſo glorious fixes the Infallibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Apoſtles above all manner of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. So long as our Lord and Saviour ſhall be acknowledged for Infallible, we muſt confeſs that his Promiſe has been fulfill'd, and that as he had promiſed, his Apoſtles exempt from error, were guided in all truth. Every Chriſtian is bound to acknowledge the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality of this Promiſe, and by conſequence the infallibility of the Apoſtles. They were guided in all truth and conſequently they were infallible. Theſe are expreſſions which carry one and the ſame ſence.</p>
               <p>I do not pretend to drive the thing ſo far, as to maintain upon this Foundation, that the Apoſtles were univerſally inſtructed in all things, even in ſuch things as had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to their Apoſtleſhip. The Holy Ghoſt did not impart himſelf to thoſe Holy Men, but in what they ſtood in need of as Apoſtles, and Teachers of Mankind. What they did
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:98516:47"/>as ſuch, was under the immediate direction of the Holy Ghoſt. I carry their Inſpiration no higher. When they preach'd the Goſpel, when they made their defences before Magiſtrates, when they wrote concerning Chriſtianity, when they debated matters of Piety. Theſe were Apoſtolic Functions which they performed by the direction of the Spirit of Truth.</p>

               <p>NOthing is more proper to explain the ſenſe of a divine Promiſe than the performance of it. I have ſaid, that our Lord and Saviour promis'd his Apoſtles the aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of his Spirit in all their Apoſtolic Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions: Let no body miſtake himſelf in main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining, that by this general Promiſe our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour meant the Gifts of Miracles which ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver failed the Apoſtles in the exerciſe of their Duties. If that were the whole extent of the Promiſe, <hi>M. N.</hi> would aſſert, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles of the Apoſtles would be no good proofs of their Infallibility, becauſe ſeveral private men have had the Gift of Miracles that were not infallible.</p>
               <p>Though it were true that the Miracles which the Primitive Chriſtians wrought were no proofs of the certainty and ſoundneſs of their Faith, yet I ſay that the ſame argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is not to be made uſe of in reference to the Apoſtles, as in relation to other Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians. Let us always look upon the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles as Inſtruments that God has made choice of to inſtruct all Mankind. Let us never quit that Idea, to the end we may underſtand
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:98516:48"/>after a juſt and true manner the nature of thoſe Graces which the Holy Ghoſt imparted to them. Let it be aſſerted, that the gift of working Miracles was not incompatible with the infidelity of ſeveral bad Chriſtians, that cannot be averred in reference to the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, becauſe it was by their means that God inſtructed his whole Church. He could not ſuffer them to go aſtray in teaching any thing that was falſe, while he imparted to them the gift of Miracles. Otherwiſe he would have authoriz'd a Lye in the Apoſtles, and all thoſe Swervings and Deviations, wherein they might have engag'd the Church: which was utterly oppoſite to his deſign, which was to make them Miniſters of the Truth. I have good reaſon therefore to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the Spirit of Miracles, that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour promiſed and granted to his Apoſtles, that he would continue to them that Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, which was a Prerogative neceſſary to their Apoſtleſhip.</p>
               <p>I ſhould reaſon thus, although our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour had only barely promis'd his Spirit of Miracles to his Apoſtles. But we ſtand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a much more ſolid Foundation, ſeeing that he expreſly promiſes <hi>a Spirit of Truth; a Spirit which ſhould teach all things; a Spirit that ſhould guide them in all Truth.</hi> The Truth, or Infallibility is the principal thing which he promiſes. If he were ſo faithful as to his promiſe of the Gifts of Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, would he have been leſs punctual in a Promiſe upon which he much more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably inſiſted?</p>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:98516:48"/>
               <p>I ſhall not make any ſtop in diſcourſing of the manner how this Promiſe of Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility was fulfilled, in any other places than in the writings of the Apoſtles; to which I am only to confine my ſelf. The only Uſe which I would make of other occaſions, ſhould be to conclude, that if our Saviour gave his Spirit of Truth to the Apoſtles upon occaſions of leſs importance, than when they wrote concerning Religion, the reaſon is ſo much the ſtronger, that he aſſiſted them in their writings. For inſtance, I find that in the Council of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> where the Queſtion was debated, Whether the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians ſhould ſubmit themſelves to the Yoke of Circumciſion; the Holy Ghoſt directs the Conſultations of the Apoſtles, and empowr's them to ſay, <hi>It has ſeemed meet to us and to the Holy Spirit.</hi> How is it probable that he forſook the Apoſtles in the Compoſition of Writings which contain'd the Sovereign De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion of all the important Queſtions that could be put up in the Church? The Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is true: for ſeeing the Holy Ghoſt preſided in the Council of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> it is not to be conceiv'd, that he neglected wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of much greater moment, than that Council was.</p>
               <p>Let us come a little nearer to the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe Sacred Writings. The Promiſe of this Spirit of Truth has been fulfilled: it has enlighten'd the Apoſtles: let us judge of all the reſt by St. <hi>Paul,</hi> the laſt who was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. He tells the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that the Holy Spirit inſtructed him; <hi>But God has revealed
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:98516:49"/>them unto us by his Spirit. Now we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived not the Spirit of the World, but the Spirit which is of God, that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God. Which things alſo we ſpeak, not in the words which mans wiſdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghoſt teacheth, comparing ſpiritual Things with ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.</hi> In another place, the ſame Apoſtle ſays, that becauſe of the Excellency of the Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation wherewith he was honoured,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.7.</note> 
                  <hi>a Thorn was given him, leſt he ſhould be exalted above meaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He compares this <hi>Illumination</hi> to that which God wrought at the beginning of the World when he commanded Light out of Darkneſs. So that there is no queſtion but that St. <hi>Paul</hi> was inſpir'd; and if he, then all the reſt of the Apoſtles alſo. But to what purpoſe would this <hi>Inſpiration</hi> have ſerv'd, had it not been tranſmitted into their Writings. Thoſe Holy Men were inſpir'd that they might be able to inſtruct the Church. If the Holy Spirit, after he had imparted to them his Light, had not taken care to diffuſe it into their VVri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, it would have been abſolutely uſeleſs to us. I conclude from thence, that the Spirit of Truth after it had illuminated their Minds, guided their Pens, to the end their Light might be tranſmitted to Poſterity. There are particular Paſſages that poſitively prove the fulfilling of the Promiſe, as I have ſaid already; but they deſerve a Chapter by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein are produc'd ſeveral Paſſages of Scripture, which ſhew that the Sacred Writers of the New Teſtament have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, that they were inſpir'd in their Writings.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>'TIS now time to paſs to particular Proofs which are to be found ſcatter'd here and there in the Writings of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The Enemies of their Inſpiration ſet a high Value upon the Objection which they fetch from hence, that the Apoſtles never begin their Diſcourſes, as the Prophets do, by ſaying, <hi>The Mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken it;</hi> and are ſo daring, as to aſſert, that the Sacred Writers of the New Teſtament ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver thought, nor deſired it ſhould be thought that there Writings were inſpir'd. I muſt confeſs, that the Apoſtles do not ſay in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Words, <hi>The Mouth of the Lord hath thus ſpoken.</hi> For in regard that the Prophets did not enjoy the Benefit of Inſpiration but by Intervals, there was ſome kind of neceſſity that thoſe Holy Men ſhould declare, what things thoſe were which they had learn'd by Revelation. It was not the ſame thing with the Apoſtles, in regard they were aſſur'd, that the Holy Ghoſt aſſiſted 'em always, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Promiſe of Jeſus Chriſt, in
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:98516:50"/>Matters of Religion. More eſpecially it ought to be obſerved, that it is not true, that the Prophets always began their Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetick Writings with theſe Words, <hi>The Mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken.</hi> Let 'em read the Five Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and they ſhall find ſeveral Proofs of what I affirm. That Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator without any more ado begins with theſe Words: <hi>In the beginning God created the Heavens and the Earth.</hi> Nor is the Book of <hi>Exodus</hi> ſignaliz'd with any other better Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Inſpiration. Nevertheleſs, 'tis known, that thoſe Two Books are no leſs inſpir'd, than the Propheſies that command Attention with theſe Words at the Beginning, <hi>The Mouth of the Lord has ſpoken.</hi> Let 'em not therefore have a worſe Opinion of the Writings of the New Teſtament, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that theſe Words are not there.</p>
               <p>In the Old Teſtament, that which was merely Hiſtorical, was not introduc'd with this Preface, <hi>The Mouth of the Lord has ſpoke.</hi> This is uſually reſerv'd for parts that are purely Prophetick, wherein the Spirit of God had a ſingular Concern. Now I af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that the New Teſtament, in thoſe parts that contain ſome Prophecies, marks out their Original as diſtinctly as if the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had ſaid, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord has ſpoke it.</hi> As for the Hiſtorical Parts, and ſuch as undertake Argument, 'tis not to be thought ſtrange, if we do not there meet with the ſame Character. That is common to both Teſtaments; they never expreſly attribute to God any more than his Oracles. But that is
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:98516:50"/>no Obſtruction, but that what thoſe Holy Men either wrote or thought under the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Holy Ghoſt, may not be in ſome meaſure inſpir'd. I ſhall diſcourſe of that more diſtinctly in the Series of this Treatiſe. I have ſaid enough to ſhew, that the Old Teſtament has no advantage over the New, in reſpect of Inſpiration, and that they are in the wrong who deny this Truth, under pretence that the Prophets ſay ſometimes, <hi>The Mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken,</hi> but the Apoſtles never make uſe of that Expreſſion.</p>
               <p>As to what they add, that the Apoſtles ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver pretended to Inſpiration, and that they have not mention'd any thing of it in their Writings, it is eaſie to be diſcern'd, that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſtands upon a weaker Foundation, than this Objection. In ſhort, the Apoſtles let us know, that they had receiv'd from Heaven what we call Prophetick Parts; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times it was in Viſion, ſometimes by the Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtions of the Spirit. As to other Parts, beſides that I have already obſerv'd, that the Works which compoſe the New Teſtament, are written by Authors which the Holy Ghoſt had inveſted with Endowments ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to make that Book the Foundation of Truth, I could wiſh that ſomething of At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention might be given to ſome expreſs Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſures the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that he had the Mind of Chriſt,<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.16.</note>
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> and in another place, after he had given his Judgment upon ſeveral Scruples that aroſe in point of Marriage, he ſays that he ſpeaks <hi>by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:98516:51"/>not by command;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 7.</note> and that <hi>he gives his Judgment as one that has obtain'd Mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</hi> Is not this of as great Force, as if he had ſaid, all theſe Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons which I have given you were inſpir'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>The Thing ſpeaks it ſelf; S. <hi>Paul</hi> affirms, that what he wrote to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Marriage, was the Work of the Holy Ghoſt. For theſe Words, <hi>Now I believe that I have the Spirit of God,</hi> either ſignifie nothing where they are placed; or elſe they ſignifie, that what the holy S. <hi>Paul</hi> had wrote, was by the Guidance of the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>'Tis the general Intention of this Apoſtle, that he ſhould be look'd upon as a perſon in whom the Spirit of God reſided, to render him capable to inſtruct others. <hi>The good thing that was committed unto thee,</hi>

He therefore that deſpiſeth, deſpiſeth not man, but God, who hath alſo given unto us his Holy Spirit.

               <p>S. <hi>Peter</hi> is no leſs poſitive. <hi>This Second Epiſtle, beloved, I now write unto you — That ye may be mindful of the Words which were ſpoken before by the Holy Prophets,</hi>

Will any Man ſay, that a perſon who thus expreſſes himſelf did believe that the Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the Apoſtles were not inſpir'd?</p>
               <p>In the ſame Chapter, S. <hi>Peter</hi> gives an Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick Teſtimony in favour of the Epiſtles of S. <hi>Paul; Even as our beloved Brother Paul alſo, according to the Wiſdom given unto him,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Pet. 3.15, 16.</note> 
                  <hi>has alſo written unto you, as alſo in all his Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; ſpeaking in them of theſe Things: in which are ſome things hard to be underſtood, which they that are unlearned and unſtable wreſt, as they do alſo the other Scriptures.</hi> Theſe Words furniſh us with two convincing Arguments in favour of the Inſpiration of the Epiſtles of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> 1. They were written according to the Wiſdom which S. <hi>Paul</hi> had receiv'd from Heaven: I have already touch'd upon this Argument. The other is, that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles of S. <hi>Paul</hi> are reckon'd in the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the inſpir'd Scriptures, <hi>which the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and unſtable wreſt as they do the other Scriptures.</hi> Aſſuredly, by thoſe other Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures, S. <hi>Peter</hi> means the inſpir'd Scriptures, of which Jeſus Chriſt ſays in another place, <hi>You go aſtray not knowing the Scriptures;</hi> and which the New Teſtament uſually cites as the Work of the Holy Ghoſt. The Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Hand is about the Scriptures which the <hi>unlearned wreſt to their own deſtruction,</hi>
                  <pb n="92" facs="tcp:98516:52"/>which can be meant of no other than of the Holy Scripture. S. <hi>Peter</hi> does not complain of the Unlearned for wreſting the Scriptures, but for wreſting the other Scriptures. VVhence it is evident, that the Epiſtles of S. <hi>Paul</hi> are reckon'd in the Number of the inſpir'd Scriptures. Can any thing be more poſitively expreſs'd upon the Inſpiration of the VVorks that make up the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment?</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein is drawn from the Gift of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcerning of Spirits granted to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Chriſtians a Proof, very much in Favour of the Sacred Books which the Apoſtles have left us.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MEN diſpute about the Marks where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they might formerly know the true Prophets. Commonly it is affirm'd, that Miracles, or the Accompliſhment of the Prophecy was the true Proof of a real Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet. But it may be ſaid, that this is not always certain; for it would be a difficult thing to prove, that all the Prophets verified their Miſſion by Miracles, or by accompliſh'd Prophecies. This was not altogether ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary but when there was ſomething of great Importance, that was the Subject of the Prophecy. For to what purpoſe was it
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:98516:52"/>to make a great Noiſe and a ſtir, when there was nothing more in the Buſineſs, than to reduce Sinners into the right Path that had been traced by a Law ſupported by ſo many Miracles.</p>
               <p>God never overturns the Laws of Nature, unleſs there be ſome neceſſary occaſion. I ſhould have rather ſaid, that the Miracles of a true Prophet become ſerviceable to him that wrought none at all: wherein I thus explain my ſelf. When a Prophet had juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied his Miſſion by ſome Miracles, he was acknowledg'd for a Man of God. After which his Teſtimony was as good as a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle to other Prophets, while he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd that thoſe new Prophets were ſent by the ſame Maſter. This Atteſtation remov'd all Occaſion of Doubts. When we find that certain Books of the Old Teſtament want theſe authentick Proofs of their Divinity, which other Books have, that are look'd upon in the firſt Order of Canonical, we are confirm'd by underſtanding, that thoſe Books, about which ſome Men would raiſe Diſputes and Doubts, paſs'd through the Hands of the laſt Prophets truly inſpir'd. I ſay the ſame thing of perſons; a Prophet whoſe Miſſion was not honor'd by Miracles was acknowledg'd upon the Inſpiration of another Prophet whoſe Atteſtation had been prov'd.</p>
               <p>I apply this Argument to my Subject. They who had no good Opinion of the Works of S. <hi>Mark</hi> and S. <hi>Luke,</hi> becauſe they were not Apoſtles, ought to alter their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent,
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:98516:53"/>when they conſider, that the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts had the Approbation of the Apoſtles. How ſhall we prove, that the Apoſtles were worthy to be credited? We have their Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles; but we have alſo other Proof, from the Conduct which God obſerv'd in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding credible Teſtimonies among the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Chriſtians to juſtifie the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>'Tis known, that among them, there were ſeveral to whom God had granted the Talent of diſcerning Spirits.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.7, 8, 10.</note> S. <hi>Paul</hi> is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive in it: <hi>But the manifeſtation of the Spirit is given to every man to profit withal. For to one is given by the Spirit the word of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; to another the word of knowledge by the ſame ſpirit. — To another the working of miracles; to another prophecy; to another diſcerning of Spirits.</hi> This is no bare natural Diſcerning, ſince it is reckon'd in the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of miraculous Gifts. The Spirit of God taught ſeveral Chriſtians how to underſtand Perſons, and Doctrines truly inſpir'd. Several make no ſcruple to refer to this what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays of the Spiritual Man.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 2.15.</note> 
                  <hi>But he that is ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual, judges all things.</hi> This is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood of the things of God.<note place="margin">14.29.</note> 
                  <hi>Let the Prophets ſpeak two or three, and let the other judge.</hi> Thus you ſee the diſcerning of Spirits e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd. Verſe 22. of the ſame Chapter, 'tis ſaid, <hi>The Spirits of the Prophets are ſubject to the Prophets:</hi> which is uſually explain'd by ſaying, that the Prophets of the New Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant were Maſters of themſelves to obſerve ſilence, till they had an opportunity to ſpeak. But nothing hinders, but that it may be
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:98516:53"/>meant of that ſame Dependance which ſome of the Prophets had upon others, when the one examin'd the other. In which Sence, <hi>the Prophets were ſubject to the Prophets.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſame Chapter furniſhes me with an undeniable Proof to uphold my Argument.<note place="margin">Verſ. 37.</note> 
                  <hi>If any Man think himſelf to be a Prophet or ſpiritual,</hi> ſays S. <hi>Paul, let him acknowledge that the things which I write unto you are the commandments of the Lord.</hi> If any one thinks himſelf to be a Prophet, or ſpiritual; that is, according to the Phraſe of Scripture, <hi>If any be a Prophet, or ſpiritual, let him acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> &amp;c. Spiritual perſons then might diſcern, if what S. <hi>Paul</hi> wrote came from the Lord. The Epiſtles of that Sacred Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor paſs'd for ſuch a Proof which might well be call'd the Judgment of God, ſince it was God who inſpir'd Spiritual Men. This Conſideration may ſerve for the Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of ſeveral Places of S. <hi>Paul,</hi> he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes his Writings to the Judgment of Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Men, Men judicious and diſcerning, eſtabliſh'd by Grace to corroborate the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Apoſtles. By that means it was plainly diſcern'd, that there was nothing ſpurious in their Writings; and that they contain'd neither Arguments nor Matters of Fact which were not exactly according to the Weights of the Sanctuary.</p>

You ſhall hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meet with one of a thouſand that ever thought of this Doctrine. Is it among the Learned? Then he ought to have prov'd it by good Citations. Number of Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons commonly ſpoiles a Book; But when it is a man's Buſineſs to prove a matter of Fact which ſerves for a Foundation to a Book, and that this matter of Fact becomes a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Controverſie; the want of Quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is in my Opinion very Eſſential. At leaſt <hi>M. N.</hi> ought to have repair'd this defect in the Defence of his <hi>Memoir.</hi> But ſince he has not done it, we have great reaſon to believe he could not do it. All that he ſays is this. <hi>That after the death of</hi> Grotius, <hi>there appear'd a third Anſwer of</hi> Rivet, <hi>wherein he endeavoured to defend the Common Opinion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Illuſtrious Antagoniſt. 'tis clearly to be ſeen by the manner of his Anſwer, that he believ'd that the Holy Ghoſt dictated the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture word for word, and we know that it is the moſt common Opinion among the Proteſtants, who every moment call the Sacred Writers the</hi> Amanuenſes <hi>of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> I read that
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:98516:55"/>part of <hi>Rivet</hi>'s Piece, but could not there find it out that this was his Opinion: and I deny it to be the Common Opinion of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines.</p>
               <p>It was not the Opinion of <hi>Burman,</hi> the Famous Profeſſor of <hi>Utrecht.</hi> He aſſerts, that the Sacred Writers wrote by the inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Ghoſt, whoſe Inſtruments in a manner they were. Theſe words ſeem'd to favour <hi>M. N</hi>'s Pretenſion. But let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what <hi>Burman</hi> meant by <hi>Inſpiration,</hi> and by that means we may be able to explain ſeveral Expreſſions which are to be found in our Authors. That Author ſeems to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, that the Sacred Writers were but the Inſtruments by which the Holy Ghoſt wrote word for word whatever they left us. <hi>How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever that is done,</hi> continues the ſame Author, <hi>with ſome variety: in ſome things which they were taught of God, they were but bare</hi> Amanuenſes. <hi>In others they wrote like Hiſtorians according to the wiſdom that was given them.</hi>

He did not take from them their natural Faculty of reaſoning; but after be had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd it with Celeſtial Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, he directed and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern'd it by his ſecret vertue, that the Reſult of their Meditati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons might be the Voice of God.</hi> Here is no ſuch thing as <hi>Teaching</hi> that the Holy Ghoſt dictated word for word (to ſpeak properly) all thoſe things which were written by the Apoſtles. Were theſe two Profeſſors ever Cenſur'd for having departed from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Belief?</p>
               <p>Not to heap up Quotations, I ſhall only obſerve two things which will ſupply their number: the one is, that <hi>M. Capel,</hi> a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Profeſſor at <hi>Saumur,</hi> and ſome other Proteſtant Divines were ſomewhat enclined to believe that the Apoſtles might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in ſome ſmall Circumſtances of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact which they relate; as in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Names, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> I hope to ſhew in the following Chapters, that it is not at all neceſſary to grant that for the reconciling
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:98516:56"/>of certain places which give ſome Colour to this Belief. The only thing which I have here to obſerve is this, that neither <hi>M. Capel,</hi> nor thoſe other Divines, who are ſo pliable to favour the pretended Defects of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles memory, did ever believe that the Holy Ghoſt dictated to them the whole, word for word. For he that could believe that, could never queſtion the Infallibility of every Syllable.</p>
               <p>The other Obſervation which I make is this, that the Common Belief of the Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Divines is, that the Apoſtles made uſe of their Reaſon, their Memory, and a Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage which ſavoured much of their Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and their natural Genius. Let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from thence, that the common Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is not, that the Apoſtles, when they wrote, were under a perpetual <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> and that they only ſupplied the Holy Ghoſt with their Pens, while he dictated to them word for word whatever they wrote. To put an end to this Obſervation, I may ſay that I have conſulted upon this Point, ſeveral Divines both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>French,</hi> and yet could never meet with one that was of this Opinion, which <hi>M. N.</hi> calls the <hi>Common Opinion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs, that becauſe hitherto none of our Divines has yet dreſſed up any Syſtem upon this Subject, but onely that ſeveral have ſpoken of it by the by, many expreſſions have eſcap'd them, of which an ill uſe might be made to make the World believe, that their Opinion is exactly the
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:98516:57"/>ſame which <hi>M. N.</hi> aſcribes to them. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Language, the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters are the Secretaries of the Holy Ghoſt; he inſpires them whatever they write. But theſe Expreſſions, and all thoſe of the like nature may ſubſiſt without ſuppoſing ſuch an Inſpiration as is attributed to us. I ſhall make out hereafter: It's enough for this place, to ſay, that all thoſe Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that our Divines have made uſe of in imitation of the ancient Fathers of the Church, are made good by that ſhare which the Holy Ghoſt has in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred VVritings of the New Teſtament. It contains ſeveral Oracles which the Holy Ghoſt did dictate: as for other things, the Apoſtles were under the immediate dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Holy Ghoſt, who infallibly guiding their Pens, adopted whatever they wrote. Such a Guidance as cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, without overthrowing Fundamentals. VVhich being granted, all Divines may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow all thoſe honourable Expreſſions upon the Apoſtolic VVritings, and look upon them as the work of the Holy Ghoſt. This is the Idea, which we have in general of the Inſpiration of theſe Sacred Writings, and which we are now going more particularly to explain.</p>

                  <p>Wherein is explained the nature of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the New Teſtament, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of Revelations.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THat we may have a diſtinct Idea of the Inſpiration of the Holy VVritings, 'tis requiſite to diſtinguiſh the Things which they contain; which I ſhall do into three Orders. In the firſt I ſhall put the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations. The ſecond is for thoſe things which the Apoſtles learn'd by the natural aſſiſtances of their Hearing and Sight. In the third you ſhall ſee the Progreſs which they made by reaſoning upon the Truths of the two firſt Orders. This diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on preſents it ſelf at firſt to the mind; ſo that you ſee the Apoſtles wrote things which they knew by Revelation, by Sence, or by reaſoning. I deſign this Chapter for the Truths which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by way of Revelation.</p>
               <p>There is no need of inſiſting long upon it; becauſe there does not appear to be any Conteſt between <hi>M. N.</hi> and us upon this Subject. He agrees, that the Apoſtles have ſaid ſeveral things by Inſpiration.<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Sentim.</hi> p 240. <hi>lb.</hi> p 252.</note> 
                  <hi>I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> ſays he, <hi>that the Apoſtles might have certain Prophetic Inſpirations, and that they really had ſuch.</hi> And in another place, <hi>Not
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:98516:58"/>but that they had ſeveral immediate Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations and ſeveral Viſions, as appears by the Acts, by the Apocalypſe, and by divers other parts of their Writings.</hi> And toward the end of the twelfth Letter, <hi>There are ſeveral Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſies ſcattered in their Writings, and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypſe is altogether Prophetic: and we ought to give Credit to thoſe Revelations, becauſe it was God that ſent them immediately to his Apoſtles. M. N.</hi> conſtantly maintains this Theſis in the defence of his <hi>Sentiments;</hi> where he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo advances ſomething more to the purpoſe,<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>We both agree then, that there are in the VVritings of the Apoſtles ſeveral things which thoſe Holy Men learn'd by the way of Suggeſtion. There needs no more to put the Buſineſs paſt all diſpute but to read the Apoſtolick writings themſelves.

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:98516:58"/>the day time that S. <hi>Peter</hi> had a Viſion in the behalf of the Centurion <hi>Cornelius.</hi> The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had alſo Viſions in the Night time.<note place="margin">

The Apoſtles heard Voices from Heaven. The Lord ſaid to St. <hi>Paul, My Grace is ſufficient for thee; for my ſtrength is made perfect in weakneſs.</hi> There are ſeveral inſtances, whereby it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that the Holy Ghoſt did ſecretly inſtruct the Apoſtles. VVhen St. <hi>Peter</hi> was pondring upon the Viſion which he had ſeen, the Spirit told him, <hi>Behold three men ſeek thee.

               </p>
               <p>'Tis plain, that it was not the Spirit of St. <hi>Peter</hi> which is ſpoken of in that place. Which I add, to the end men may not think, that by the <hi>Spirit</hi> is meant a bare diſpoſition of Piety. The Queſtion is about a <hi>Spirit,</hi> who had ſent three men to St. <hi>Peter.</hi> The ſame Spirit, the ſame Perſon admoniſh'd him to go and meet them. Sometimes alſo the particular inclinations of the Apoſtles were withſtood by the inſpiration of this Spirit, ſo true it is that it never ſignified the natural inclinations of their Piety. The thing is of that importance as deſerves a Proof; and there needs no more for one to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, than to read the ſixteenth Chapter of the <hi>Acts. After they were come into</hi> Myſia,<note place="margin">

                  </gap>, The Spirit ſays diſtinctly and in expreſs terms, <hi>That in the later times ſome ſhall depart from the faith.</hi> The Apoſtles, as we ſhall find hereafter, wrote ſome things wherein the Holy Ghoſt was no otherwiſe concern'd than by way of Direction; but they wrote other things which he ſuggeſted expreſly to them.

N.</hi> ſays, <hi>that we ought to give Credit to thoſe Revelations, becauſe it was God who ſent them immediately.</hi> That is certain, but if the Apoſtles have either maliciouſly, or for want of Memory, corrupted their Revelations,
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:98516:59"/>where ſhall we be then? <hi>M. N.</hi> anſwers that they were men of Probity, and that we ought to rely upon their Sincerity. They were men of Probity, 'tis true; but it muſt be agreed at the ſame time, that it was not an infallible Probity; and that it was not impoſſible but that they might injure the Truth. 'Tis to be agreed alſo that their Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory might deceive them. It is clear then, that if the Holy Ghoſt left them to their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, our warrants for the truth of their Revelations is not over abounding. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we muſt of neceſſity admit the Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Holy Spirit.</p>
               <p>VVhen we ſeriouſly dive into the writings of theſe Gentlemen, there is a great deal of reaſon to ſuſpect that they ſeem to have ſome regard for the Apoſtolic Revelations, only to make ſome ſhew. They do not believe they do any injury to their Darling Principle, which reduces all Religion to Reaſon purely Natural. They know well that the number of theſe Revelations is not conſiderable. And ſhould we oppoſe againſt them any one that annoy'd them never ſo little, they would from the Infirmities of the Apoſtles derive an argument which ſhould bring their Revelations to the trial.</p>
               <p>Their Conceſſions are exactly calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for their Principles, ſpecious appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances which ſignifie little. Such is their Confeſſion of the Infallibility of Jeſus Chriſt. They diſcourſe of it in pompous Terms, which however are of no great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:98516:60"/>to the Chriſtian Religion. For ſince he has not written any thing, all that comes onely to the infallibility of Preaching. If a Doctrine taught <hi>viva voce</hi> with Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility be intruſted to Writers that may fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifie it, 'tis evident that their Writings can be no foundation of a certain Belief. And therefore we have a priviledge to examin what they have written by the Rules of ſound Judgement. And to this it is that they would reduce all Religion.</p>
               <p>But not to ſpeak at preſent of any other Revelations than what the Apoſtles had, 'tis ſeen, that though an Infallible Spirit ſuggeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, they loſe the Prerogative of their original Infallibility, when they come once to be handled by the Apoſtles, in caſe the Holy Ghoſt had ſuffered thoſe Revelations be obſcur'd by human infirmities. I ſay then, that the Holy Ghoſt acts two ways, by relation to the truths which he hath revealed by the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. Firſt he ſuggeſted thoſe truths which he imprinted in their Souls by ſome of thoſe ways which I have ſet down, wherein the Apoſtles were in a paſſive diſpoſition. like a piece of Cloth that receives the Colours. 'Tis in this manner that they were inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but when they ſet themſelves to inſtruct others, and communicate in writing what the Holy Ghoſt had taught them, he acted after another manner; he puſh'd them for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to write, he ſtrengthen'd and refreſhed their Memories, and ſo directed their Pens, that they wrote nothing which was not to
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:98516:60"/>the purpoſe, and according to the moſt exact Rules of Truth. There was then in the written Revelations which they have left us, two ſorts of Inſpiration: Inſpiration of Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, and Inſpiration of Direction.</p>

There are an infinite number of Things which enter into the Minds of the moſt vulgar Souls, even without ſtudy, I do not pretend that the Apoſtles were learned and witty Men at the time they were called. 'Tis known, that unleſs it were S. <hi>Paul,</hi> whoſe Education had been ſingular; the other Apoſtles were very rude and unpoliſh'd; and they had reaſon to make of their Ignorance a Glorious Monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the Holy Ghoſt, who with ſuch feeble Inſtruments triumph'd, and caus'd the Goſpel to triumph in all Places. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this is no Hinderance, but that it muſt be agreed, that the Apoſtles had repleniſh'd their Minds with ſeveral things which they had learn'd without the Help of Study. They had general Ideas that are obvious to the moſt illiterate; and they had other Ideas with which their Profeſſion and common Converſation furniſh'd 'em.</p>
               <p>The Inſtruction which they receiv'd in Religion was at two times; before, and after their Call, to the Apoſtleſhip. Before their Call, they knew as much as had been uſually taught of the Jewiſh Religion to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon People, whether by the Expoſition of Scripture, or the Rehearſal of ſome Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. After their Call, for three or four years they ſaw and heard what is to be read in the Goſpels.</p>
               <p>Theſe are thoſe things which enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Minds of the Apoſtles by ſeeing and hearing, and which have their Place in the
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:98516:61"/>Apoſtolick Writings. Common Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge furniſh'd 'em with Alluſions, Meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phors, Proverbs and Maxims of Wiſdom. The Knowledge of Religion challenges the firſt Rank in Scripture: there, we ſee the Chriſtian ingrafted upon the Jew, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel added to the Law; the Apoſtles wrote concerning Chriſtianity as People that had been Jews.</p>
               <p>Our Buſineſs is to decide how the Holy Ghoſt guided the Apoſtles in thoſe things which they knew by the ways already ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd. 'Tis clear, that a new Suggeſtion was abſolutely uſeleſs; and as we ought not at any time to have Recourſe to Miracles, but in a Caſe of Neceſſity, we ſhould vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late that Maxim, by affirming, that the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt ſuggeſted and whiſper'd into the Ears of the Apoſtles what they knew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. He was not oblig'd to begin, but where Nature had ended: 'twas enough that he ſpoke, when ſhe became ſilent.</p>
               <p>Let us not imagine however that he was only a Spectator of the Functions of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. He brought her to perfection, and hinder'd her from going aſtray. In the Hands of this great Maſter the Faculties of the Soul receiv'd a new Degree of Strength, the Senſes more faithfully admitted the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Objects, the Memory was refreſh'd and confirm'd, and the Judgment found the way not to be deceiv'd. 'Tis my Opinion, that it cannot be deny'd, but that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles found all theſe Advantages in the aſſiſtance of a Spirit that in a moment
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:98516:62"/>taught 'em to ſpeak Foreign Languages; that in Anſwer to their Prayers, reviv'd the dead; but (which appears to us yet more conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable for our Purpoſe) who made choice of the Apoſtles to make 'em Maſters, whoſe Credit ſhould be ſo great, as that the Faith of the People might rely upon their Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
               <p>We have thus ſeen that the Apoſtles learn'd, by the aſſiſtance of their Senſes, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral things before they were call'd, and after they were called; thoſe things enter'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Compoſition of the Sacred Books un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the immediate Direction of the Holy Ghoſt. Natural Ideas, common Ideas, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas of their Profeſſion; all theſe became ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable as well as the Ideas of Religion.</p>
               <p>The ſhare which we believe the Holy Ghoſt had in the writing of thoſe things, is,
<list>
                     <item>1. That he was the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> of that Compoſition; 'twas he that ſet the Apoſtles at work, whether it were in furniſhing 'em with Occaſions and Subjects to write upon, or whether it were by ſecretly ſtirring 'em up to write, I may ſay he put the Pen in their Hands.</item>
                     <item>2. He preſided in the Choice of the Matter which was to be put into the Work, not ſuffering the Apoſtles to write any thing but what was true, and to the purpoſe. This is an Inſpiration of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection: nor does there need any more to be ſaid, as to the <hi>Truths</hi> which they had <hi>heard</hi> and <hi>ſeen.</hi> We ſhall ſee hereafter what ſort of Infallibility ariſes from this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.</item>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein is Explain'd the Nature of the Inſpiration of the Sacred Books of the New Teſtament, in reference to the Progreſs which the Apoſtles might be able to make, in reaſoning upon the Truths ſuggeſted by the Holy Ghoſt, and upon thoſe which they had learn'd by the way of Senſe.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THere are in the Writings of the Apoſtles ſeveral things which appear to proceed from their own Brains, and which are as it were the Additions of their Reaſon. This appears, both in reſpect to the Oracles which the Holy Ghoſt ſuggeſted to 'em, and in reſpect of thoſe things which they had learn'd by Hearing and Seeing.</p>
               <p>'Tis known to be the uſual Cuſtom of the Apoſtles, to accompany the Truths which the Spirit ſuggeſted to 'em with certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections. For inſtance, S. <hi>Peter</hi> joyning the Viſion of the Sheet, to the Viſion that was ſeen by <hi>Cornelius, Of a truth,</hi> ſays he, <hi>now I perceive, that God is no reſpecter of perſons,</hi> &amp;c. S. <hi>Paul,</hi> after he had declared what the Spirit had ſaid in expreſs Terms,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.1.</note> touching ſuch as ſhould depart from the Faith, makes a ſhort Diſcourſe upon it. S. <hi>Peter</hi> underſtanding by
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:98516:63"/>Revelation the near approach of his Death, concludes from thence, that it behov'd him to be a good Husband of his Time, and to inculcate the Truths of the Goſpel into the Hearts of the Chriſtians, in ſuch ſort that they might ſurvive him.<note place="margin">2 Pet. 1.12, 13, 14.</note> 
                  <hi>Wherefore,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I will not be negligent to put you all in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of theſe things, tho ye know them, and be eſtabliſh'd in the preſent Truth. Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this Tabernacle to ſtir you up, by putting you in remembrance; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ſhortly I muſt put off this Tabernacle, even as our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath ſhewed me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When thus they reaſon'd upon the Oracles, the Apoſtles had no need of being inſpired; to take the Word in a Senſe of Suggeſtion. Their Reaſon, fortified and guided by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt, whoſe Inſtruments they were, was ſufficient for 'em to find out in the revealed Propoſitions the Concluſions that were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in 'em. Natural Logick would have ſerved the Turn, here we have no recourſe to the Holy Ghoſt, but to warrant the Infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the Reflection of the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>The ancient Oracles, that were clear, needed no more than the ordinary Direction of the Holy Ghoſt to be well underſtood, and to be the Foundation of Reflections and Exhortations. But it is plain, that for the apprehending certain Oracles which the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles apply to Chriſt, or to Matters of the Goſpel, they ſtood in need of an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Aſſiſtance, which was a ſort of Sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion. 'Tis not enough to ſay, that many
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:98516:63"/>times the Apoſtles underſtood the Senſe of Oracles, by ſome Tradition which, it may be, was preſerved ever ſince the time of the Prophets. There will ſtill remain ſome places of the Old Teſtament, in reference to which we muſt needs ſay, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles had an extraordinary Inſpiration. Such, for Inſtance, is that which allegorizes upon Mount <hi>Sina</hi> and <hi>Agar.</hi> Such is alſo that which we find in another place touching <hi>Melchiſedech.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> And ſuch are ſeveral Oracles apply'd to Jeſus Chriſt. The Holy Ghoſt diſcovered upon thoſe Occaſions, what we could never have underſtood by the uſual Keys of Scripture. The ſame Spirit which had inſpired the ancient Prophets, inſpired the Apoſtles to make 'em underſtand what was ſaid by the Prophets. He perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood his own Oracles, and all the Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical Cavils that can be oppoſed againſt the Explications which the Apoſtles make of the Old Teſtament, will never be able to carry it from the Deciſion of the Men of God.</p>
               <p>The Prophets have been always look'd upon as the Interpreters of <hi>Moſes;</hi> but as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Interpreters their Interpretations paſſed for new Oracles from whence there was no Appeal. In a word the Prophets are the beſt Commentators upon the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, becauſe they ſpoke by the ſame Spirit. Let us apply this to the Apoſtles, who are alſo, according to the Confeſſion of <hi>Spinoſa,</hi> the Prophets of the New Teſtament. They have explain'd the Old One. 'Tis by them
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:98516:64"/>that the Holy Ghoſt unfolds the Oracles which he had formerly inſpired. <hi>Curcellaeus</hi> himſelf, with all the Liberty which he takes, cannot forbear to attribute to the Inſpiration of the Holy Ghoſt, the Explana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which the Apoſtles make of the ancient Oracles.<note place="margin">Forſan etiam ad munus eorum atti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebat Prophetias ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teris Teſtamenti explicare, de quibus Petrus dicit, <hi>Ep. 2. c. 1. v. 20.</hi> Eas non fuiſſe <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>I paſs to the Evangelic Matters of Fact of which the Apoſtles were inform'd after our Lord Jeſus Chriſt had call'd 'em. For three or four years together they receiv'd his Leſſons, and ſaw his Miracles. After what manner is it, that the Apoſtles have ſet down in writing what they learn'd during all that time? Many times they have enlarg'd their Subject, they have reaſon'd the Caſe, they have explain'd. This was done naturally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Direction of the Holy Ghoſt, as I have already made out. But there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more; for if things had been barely preſented to their Memory, there would have been ſome which would have been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nigmatical to the Apoſtles, as they were when they receiv'd 'em from the firſt Hand. We know that at that time, they underſtood not ſeveral Parables; and how long was S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> before he underſtood the Calling of the Gentiles? 'Twas requiſite the Holy Ghoſt ſhould make uſe of Viſions to inſtruct that Apoſtle. 'Tis true, the Explanation was not
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:98516:64"/>always made by Viſions; for the Holy Ghoſt, had other ways to remove their Prejudices: He opened the Underſtanding of his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, to the end they might the better ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the Scriptures. After he had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighten'd them, they enlighten'd others by the Sacred Writings, and we are aſſured that we are enlighten'd by the Light of the Holy Ghoſt when we read them.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein are ſet down four Conſequences, that ariſe from the manner of Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining the manner of the Inſpiration of the New Teſtament.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Have ſhew'd that the Apoſtolic Writings are beholding for their Inſpiration, either to the ſuggeſtion of the Holy Ghoſt, or to his Direction. 'Tis needleſs to inſiſt any longer upon the firſt of theſe two ways: For beſides that the things ſuggeſted by the Holy Ghoſt make the leaſt part of the New Teſtament, we find that as they were at firſt intruſted to the memory of the Men of God, they fall at length under the way of Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction. Therefore ſince that is the prevailing Method, 'tis abſolutely requiſite that we exactly conſider the nature of it. I ſhall give it a new Light, by aſſerting diſtinct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly four Conſequences that ariſe from the
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:98516:65"/>manner which I have already explain'd.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Direction of the Holy Ghoſt ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes that the man acts, after he has been ſet to work by that Infallible Maſter who conducts him in the way of Truth. We ſhould deceive our ſelves extreamly, ſhould we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the Apoſtles in writing, were as it were inſenſible Pipes through which the Holy Ghoſt conveyed his Will. For then we ought never to ſay, <hi>the Goſpel of St. Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew,</hi> the Epiſtle of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> but the <hi>Goſpel of the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> the <hi>Epiſtle of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> According to that Hypotheſis, the Holy Ghoſt would have done all, and the man would have done nothing. This is not the Idea that we ought to have of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolic Writings. The Authors acted; the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties of the man were in motion; their Memory, their Judgement, their Will were no leſs in action than their hands in writing, or their Lips in dictating: but all this was done under the infallible direction of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>By what I have ſaid, 'tis clear that we muſt expect to ſind in the Apoſtolic Writings, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral ſteps of the method of Nature. The man, as it is uſual for him to do, according to the common courſe of study, meditates, reaſons, takes advice, and by that means ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances from Light to Light; ſeeing then that the man acts in the Apoſtles under the Direction of the Holy Ghoſt, it follows that they practis'd all this. They conſidered ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly what they did; and made uſe of their Reaſon. But this is not to be ſaid of thoſe
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:98516:65"/>Oracles which the Holy Ghoſt ſuggeſts word for word: in that caſe the man is little or nothing. But it is not ſo in theſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions wherein the Holy Spirit acts by way of Direction; for then man acts under his Orders.</p>
               <p>This being granted, 'tis no wonder that we meet with human manners of Speech in the Apoſtolic Writings. How ſhall a man deliver himſelf, if he does not ſpeak the Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of men? Let no man then be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd to ſee expreſſions importing doubt and ſcruple in the writings of the Apoſtles. This would not be proper for God to do; for God doubts of nothing: but this a man may do, though acting under the Directions of God; in regard that God, while he directs him, may ſuffer him to doubt, or let him ſpeak after the manner of men. 'Tis known, that the Apoſtles have intermix'd in their VVritings doubtful Expreſſions. <hi>It may be,</hi> ſays S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Corinthians, I will abide and winter with you.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16 6.</note> And the ſame Apoſtle, to his dear <hi>Philemon, For perhaps,</hi> ſays he, <hi>he therefore departed for a ſeaſon, that thou ſhouldſt receive him for ever.</hi> To this may be referr'd the manner of the Apoſtles counting time, they ſay, when inſtead of preciſely marking the time <hi>about that time, about ſix a Clock:</hi> this is the uſual Language of Men; nor would the Holy Ghoſt go about to reform the common Phraſes of Human Speech.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It follows alſo from the ſame Principle, that the ſtyle of the Sacred Writers has a great affinity with their Genius and their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation.
<pb n="120" facs="tcp:98516:66"/>This Remark has been made a long time ſince upon the Style of the old Prophets. With a little conſideration we may diſcover in the writings of the greateſt part both their <hi>Genius</hi> and their Profeſſion. The ſame Obſervation is to be made in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick VVritings; wherein you may find from time to time the Character of their Authors. This is a neceſſary Conſequence of the Principle which I have aſſerted, that man acted under the Direction of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p n="3">3. According to the Principle which I have laid down, there is no room for the Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction which is uſually made between words and things. Nothing is more common than to hear men ſay, that the Holy Ghoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpir'd the Things or the Thoughts, and left the choice of the words to the Diſcretion of the Apoſtles. I am apt to think that this Opinion is not to be maintain'd; at moſt it can have no other Colour, then in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of the Oracles, which the Holy Ghoſt ſuggeſted or dictated to the Apoſtles; It may be ſaid even in that occaſion, that the Holy Ghoſt inſpired as well the words as the things. So that the diſtinction is out of doors in that reſpect. But it is clear that it cannot be made uſe of upon thoſe occaſions wherein the Holy Ghoſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides no otherwiſe than by way of Direction. The words and the things depend upon one and the ſame ſort of Inſpiration: both the one and the other proceed from the ſame Spring, and are guided by the ſame hand:
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:98516:66"/>they proceed equally from human Faculties, and are equally directed by the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p n="4">4. All the Footſteps of human Wit which are to be found in the Apoſtolic VVritings, no way leſſen the authority of them: they are never a jot the leſs infallible, becauſe their Authors were guided by an infallible Spirit which directed their Compoſition. What imports their being written by Men, provided the Holy Ghoſt makes the Truth appear under the daſhes of the Pen? Men, whom the Infallible was pleas'd to guide, were them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves infallible; He lets them alone when they go right, and when they are about to miſcarry, he brings them back again. There needs no more to conduct them certainly to the truth, and to make them aſſured Condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of others: And this will more clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appear after we have conſidered where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Infallibility, which the Apoſtles ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired by the Direction of the Holy Spirit, conſiſts.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein is conſider'd the Nature of the Infallibility which ſprings from the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility of the Holy Ghoſt; and in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, touching the manner how the Apoſtles obeyed it.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>In Order to the finiſhing my Syſtem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Inſpiration of the Sacred Books of the New Teſtament, 'tis requiſite that I ſhould examin the nature of Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>libility that ſprings from the Direction of the Holy Ghoſt, for 'tis needleſs to aſſert that he directs the Authors of the New Teſtament, unleſs we know what that Direction has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duc'd. 'Tis agreed that God cannot err, and that by Conſequence the way which he ſhews us is the way of Truth. But if they whom he conducts prove Rebels to his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct; or if we are not capable to diſcern the Things wherein they are directed, or thoſe to which they are not guided, it will not be any great matter to us whether or no, we are aſſur'd that the Holy Ghoſt was pleas'd to direct them. Therefore, to lay ſome foundation of Chriſtian aſſurance di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh the manner how the Apoſtles o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bey'd that Direction, and the nature of the Things wherein they were infallibly directed.</p>
               <pb n="123" facs="tcp:98516:67"/>
               <p>It is eſſential to know the manner how the Apoſtles obeyed the Direction. If it were in their power not to have obeyed, we have no aſſurance that they were directed in the Compoſition of the Sacred Writings, and in making the Analyſis of our Faith, we ſhall aſcend to a very dubious Point. We might put the Queſtion to our ſelves; could it be impoſſible that the Apoſtles, Fiſhers as they were, ſhould withdraw themſelves from their Obedience in the ſame manner as for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <hi>Jouas</hi> did, when he was ſent to <hi>Ninive?</hi> it may be that they have not written when and how they ought to have done?</p>
               <p>If ever this Doubt be rais'd, 'tis eaſie to confute it. To which purpoſe there are two things to be conſidered, the one in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Apoſtles, the other in reference to God.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Diſpute does not lie as to one A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle ſingly; there are twelve or thirteen, who ſerve to be Examiners the one of the other. For they who have wrote, and they who have not written are equally called to the trial. If among them there was any one who through a Spirit of Rebellion was not abſolutely conformable to the direction of the Maſter, the reſt would have been all in Tumult, and either would have reclaim'd or cried down the Mutineer. But when we ſee that all the Apoſtles are in a perfect Harmony as to the Apoſtolic Writings, and in a Union Cimented with the Blood which they have ſhed to ſeal the Truth of their Teſtimony, the Doubt is diſperc'd;
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:98516:68"/>and we are perſuaded, that it is not poſſible that twelve or thirteen Witneſſes, known to be people of Integrity, ſhould concur to the ſtedfaſt maintenance of the leaſt Lye.</p>
               <p n="2">2. What I have ſaid in reference to the Apoſtles, receives a new Reinforcement from what I have to ſay in reference to God. He had engaged himſelf to honour the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of the Apoſtles with Miracles, which were the atteſtation of Heaven. Are not the Apoſtles fit to be Credited, while they are ſupported by the Depoſition of ſuch a Teſtimony? As it is impoſſible that God ſhould tell Lyes, there is alſo the ſame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility, that he ſhould authorize a Lye. Had the Apoſtles refuſed to obey the dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the Holy Ghoſt, God would have reaſſumed thoſe Gifts of Miracles from 'em, which he never had granted them, but to verifie their Doctrine and their Miſſion. Let us conclude then from his perſeverance to glorifie their Apoſtleſhip to the end of their Lives, that they inſerted nothing but what was true in thoſe Writings, where they laid up our ſacred Religion, as a Truſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their Charge.</p>
               <p>This Obſervation ſhews us, that in caſe the Apoſtles had gone aſtray, God would have made known their deviation by a Ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of their Miracles. But it behoves us to add, that it was Gods deſign to prevent that ſtarting aſide. He was reſolved that ſuch and ſuch Men ſhould be the Miniſters of his Grace throughout the Univerſe. Unleſs you will ſay, that God was not able to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:98516:68"/>them fit for this great Deſign (which is infinitely abſurd) it muſt be acknowledged that he took that preventive Care that their infirmitives ſhould not turn them out of the right Path.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Judas</hi> might be guilty of Treachery with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing the leaſt injury to this Reflexion. He loſt himſelf at a time when our Saviour was ſtill upon Earth. Though all the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles had then become Traytors, the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel would not have ſuffer'd. Jeſus Chriſt would have choſen Miniſters more faithful: But ſince he had cleans'd his Floor, and that he has ſolemnly confirm'd his Apoſtles by the Miſſion of his Spirit, let us fear nothing: 'tis for his Honour to guide 'em to the Truth; and his Deſign, by their means to preſent us with the Riches of his Grace, engages him to have a ſtrict Eye upon thoſe Miniſters, to whoſe Functions he has affixed the Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Mankind. <hi>If the Salt looſe it's ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, wherewith ſhall it be ſeaſon'd.</hi> If the Holy Ghoſt ſuffers the Apoſtles to fall, all men fall with them.</p>
               <p>Provided we conſider it well, we ſhall find that the Apoſtles might not be without ſin, and yet be infallible. Infirmities are as it were the Portion of Human Nature: they are to be met with in the choiceſt Saints; it being the pleaſure of Providence to ſhew that they are but men. But theſe Infirmities are not Eſſentials. They are ſurprizes from which they recover themſelves after a little Recollection. What has this in Common with ſuch faults as the Apoſtles might have
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:98516:69"/>committed in their Writings which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in the height of ſerious Thought, and which they never recanted? The Infirmities of the Apoſtles ſhewed that they were Men; but ſuch a conſtant Prevarication in the moſt eſſential Duty of their Function, would have made 'em to have been worſe than Devils. 'Tis therefore no true way of arguing to ſay, that becauſe the Apoſtles were not altogether without ſin, they might betray the Church by a voluntary Suppreſſion of the Council of God.</p>
               <p>But the grand Reaſon which warranted their Fidelity in the Adminiſtration of Holy Things, ought to be drawn from our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Deſign in the Choice which he made of the Apoſtles, and the Promiſe which ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd 'em capable of the Apoſtleſhip. The Deſign was by their Preaching, or by their Writing, to publiſh the Doctrine of the Goſpel. Had they dealt treacherouſly in their Miniſtry, this Deſign, upon which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the Faith of the Elect, had never been put in execution. The Promiſe was to guide the Apoſtles in all Truth. So that the ſuppoſing they might have prov'd; unfaithful, involves the Lord Jeſus himſelf in this Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of Infidelity. He promiſes that he will guide his Apoſtles to the Truth, that is to ſay, that he will make 'em faithful. So that if they ceaſe to be faithful, he ceaſes to be ſo himſelf: he fails of his Word, becauſe he does not fullfil his Promiſe.</p>
               <pb n="127" facs="tcp:98516:69"/>
               <p>To evade this Demonſtration, they cry, that provided our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares and ſhews the Truth to his Apoſtles, he is not to be blam'd in the leaſt, tho they refuſe either to follow or teach it. To which I anſwer two things: Firſt, that this Promiſe, <hi>The Spirit of Truth ſhall guide you in all Truth,</hi> implies more than a bare ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Truth. The Holy Ghoſt, if he deſign'd to be a true Conductor of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, was to guide 'em to the Mark which he ſet before 'em. Without which the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe had been but a very ſmall Comfort to 'em. They had always had this to ſay; If thou let us alone to our Infirmities, we ſhall be never the better for ſeeing a way, into which they ſhall hinder us from en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond place, there needs no more than to conſider the whole Extent of the Promiſe, to be convinced that the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filling of it did not depend upon the Good Will of the Apoſtles. 'Tis properly the Church to which Chriſt Jeſus promſes to teach the Truth by their Miniſtry. Now the Promiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made to the Church, their Rebellion would not have diſcharged Jeſus Chriſt of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe. It was abſolutely neceſſary, that the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of Truth ſhould be Maſter of the Apoſtles Pens, and guide 'em to the Truth, to the end the Church might enjoy what was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Promiſe.</p>
               <p>If I ſaid, that the Holy Ghoſt conſtrain'd the Apoſtles to follow his Directions, I might countenance the Word with the Opinion of
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:98516:70"/>ſome of the ancient Fathers. <hi>Epiphanius</hi> is po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive as to this particular. He aſſures us that the Goſpels of S. <hi>Luke</hi> and S. <hi>John</hi> were compoſed by a kind of vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Impulſe and Conſtraint,<note place="margin">Spiritus Sanctus B. Lucam occultis quibuſdam ſtimulis cogit &amp; excitat. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piph. l. 2. Tom. 1. Haereſ. 13.</hi>
                  </note> which the Holy Ghoſt put upon thoſe two Evangeliſts. He ſays, that Saint <hi>Luke</hi> was ſtirr'd up and conſtrain'd by certain ſecret Inſtigations: and that S. <hi>John</hi> wrote in deſpite of himſelf. We alſo find by a Paſſage in the Acts,<note place="margin">Deinde Spiritus Sanctus Joannem, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cet invitum, ac Religione quadam &amp; animi moderatione defugientem ad ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bendum Evangelium impulit. <hi>Ibid. Sect. 12.</hi>
                  </note> that when the Saints would have gone to one place, the Holy Ghoſt conſtrain'd 'em to go to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
               <p>The Term therefore of Conſtraint is not too hard: but let us take it in a Senſe import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a more pleaſing violence. For tho the Apoſtles had no ſuch Will, the Holy Ghoſt infus'd it into 'em, ſometimes after one Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, ſometimes after another. When the Objects were ſufficient, he let 'em alone to act by themſelves: but when the Objects were not ſufficient, he acted himſelf as he thought it convenient; but always ſo, that it was not in the power of the Apoſtles to write otherwiſe than according to his Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein is conſidered the Nature of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibility which ariſes from the Direction of the Holy Ghoſt, with reference to the Things wherein the Apoſtles were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and whether they were in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular deceived in their Opinion of the near Approach of the End of the World.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>TO the end we may well know in what things the Apoſtles were infallibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, there needs no more than to conſider the Deſign of the Holy Ghoſt in directing 'em. This Deſign was, beyond all Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, to make 'em Teachers, by whoſe Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry the world might receive the Goſpel. They were ſent to eſtabliſh the Doctrine of their Maſter. To that purpoſe it was, that they were inſtructed and guided by the Spirit of God.</p>
               <p>There are ſeveral things in the Goſpel which are uſually diſtinguiſh'd. The Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, and the Matters of Fact. But if this Diſtinction be but never ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle conſidered, it will be found that it is a Diſtinction made of things which ought not to be diſtinguiſh'd. For in the Chriſtian Religion, Matters of Fact are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:98516:71"/>Doctrines, and Doctrines are in the Nature of Matters of Fact. We find, that Matters of Fact are become Doctrines; Chriſt was born of a Virgin, ſuffered and roſe again; theſe at the ſame time are all Matters of Fact, and Doctrines; Jeſus Chriſt is equal to God his Father; Jeſus Chriſt has made an Attonement for our Sins by the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice which he offered upon the Croſs: Jeſus Chriſt promiſed that he would raiſe his faithful Diſciples again in Glory. Is it not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that theſe are Doctrines in the Nature of Matters of Fact; ſeeing the Diſpute is, whether the Apoſtles taught 'em, or rather whether our Saviour taught 'em to his Apoſtles? This is Matter of Fact, that he taught ſuch or ſuch Doctrine. The Diſtinction which I have examin'd, can have no room in reference to the Infallibility which I conſider. Viſibly the Apoſtles were directed in reſpect of Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Fact, and Doctrines; elſe they could never have given us the Goſpel under the Direction of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>'Tis much more to the purpoſe to admit another Diſtinction between the Things which the Apoſtles have written; ſome as belonging directly to the Doctrine of the Goſpel; others, as only accompanying it. 'Tis manifeſtly ſeen, that it was the Deſign of the Holy Ghoſt to direct the Apoſtles in reference to the Firſt. I ſhall not here di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh between things of greater Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and things of leſs Weight. That Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction is of it ſelf a Spring of Scruples. That which is Important for one, is not
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:98516:71"/>ſo for another. Every one has his Balance wherein he weighs his Doctrines. There are ſome indeed which are not of that weight, in reſpect of thoſe which we take to be Fundamentals. As to that Point the Holy Ghoſt has given no certain Rule, but it may be evaded by Subtlety. Whatever directly concerns our Religion ought to be a part of our Faith. Now we ſhould never have any Repoſe in our Minds, had not the Apoſtles been generally directed in all thoſe Doctrines which it behoves us to believe, as well of great as leſs Concernment without any Exception. For as we are no way exempted from believing what ſeems to us of leſs Importance; 'tis clear that in things of this Nature, as in others, that the Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the Apoſtles muſt have been ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Direction of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>There is a little more Difficulty in reſpect of thoſe things which are only accidental or acceſſary to the Evangelic Doctrine, and which do not ſeem to be any part of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of our Faith. Such are Notions purely Philoſophical, Proverbial Maxims, Quotations of Authors, the Perſonal and Domeſtic Affairs of the Apoſtles, or if there be any other Foreign Matters that happen to be inſerted in their Writings. We ſhall diſcourſe of theſe things in the following Chapter. I cannot rank amongſt theſe Matters, certain Things that very nearly border upon the Doctrine: as for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, the Time of the World's Ending. Now to make it appear, how much Error in this
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:98516:72"/>would be incompatible with the Direction of the Holy Ghoſt, there needs no more than to make the Apoſtles ſpeak after this manner: In a little time you ſhall find by experience the Truths that we have declared to ye; the World ſhall ſuddenly be at an end, the Bodies of the Living that are among ye, ſhall die, and ſhall riſe again after ſome years; and we ſhall never die.</p>
               <p>Had the Apoſtles ſpoken after this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, would they not have hazarded the Reputation of their Miracles and their Preaching: might not in this Caſe the Words of <hi>Moſes</hi> have been apply'd to 'em? <hi>When a Prophet ſpeaketh in the Name of the Lord,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Deut. 22.</note> 
                  <hi>if the thing follow not, nor come to paſs, that is the thing which the Lord hath not ſpoken, but the Prophet has ſpoken it preſumptuouſly: thou ſhalt not be afraid of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>'Tis not without Cauſe that I have alledg'd the Example of the End of the World: for that ſome Authors have drawn from thence an Argument, which in my Opinion, diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors the Infallibility of the Apoſtles. They have no way miſtaken upon this Subject. I do not ſay, that they were acquainted with the laſt Hour: the Son of God himſelf, as he was the Son of Man, was ignorant of it. Infallibility does not conſiſt in knowing eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, but in ſaying nothing, but what is certainly true. So long as we either ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or that we affirm nothing touching thoſe things of which we have no Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, we cannot be accus'd of Miſtake. This Infallibility of the Apoſtles is no
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:98516:72"/>way wounded by the Scandal thrown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on 'em in reference to the End of the World, A Reproach grounded upon Paſſages ill-underſtood; the greateſt part of which are to be explain'd of the End of the City of <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> according to the Prediction of Jeſus Chriſt, or of the End of every Man, with whom, as to his own particular, the World is at an end, when he dies.</p>
               <p>This ſuffices in anſwer to the Objection which is made againſt the Apoſtles, under pretence that they believ'd the End of the World was at hand. However, to ſtrengthen this Objection, they quote ſeveral of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cients that were under this Miſtake. But what is that to the Apoſtles, if what they ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered concerning the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem,</hi> were afterwards apply'd by other Doctors to the End of the World? The Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes of ſucceeding Ages ought not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>I ſet apart a Place wherein <hi>Grotius,</hi> and ſome others pretend, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> has expreſly declar'd, that the World was to laſt but a few years: his Words are theſe:<note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 4.</note> 
                  <hi>For the Lord himſelf ſhall deſcend from Heaven with a ſhout, with the voice of the Arch-Angel, and with the trump of God; and the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt. Then we which are alive and remain ſhall be caught up together with 'em in the clouds, to meet the Lord in the air,</hi> &amp;c. From whence they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> believ'd that the End of the World was nigh at hand: but it is an eaſie thing to demonſtrate, that this Interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is no way to be made out.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:98516:73"/>
               <p n="1">1. S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf declares in expreſs Terms, that he was not of that Belief; nor can we have a better Interpreter.<note place="margin">2 Theſſ. 2.1.</note> 
                  <hi>Now we beſeech ye, Brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and by our gathering together un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, that ye be not ſoon ſhaken in your firſt ſentiments, nor be troubled, neither upon the cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of any Prophetick Spirit, nor by Word, nor by Letter, as from us, that the day of Chriſt is at hand.</hi> Now we may ſee by that Paſſage, whether S. <hi>Paul</hi> believ'd that the End of the World was at hand. He denies it in expreſs Terms, he proteſts that he had no ſuch thought, and to render this Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtation more ſolemn, makes uſe of the Name of the Lord Jeſus. <hi>We beſeech you Brethren,</hi> &amp;c. Does he tell the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> that he was deceived in his firſt Epiſtle to them but that being better inform'd, he had a mind to diſabuſe 'em? Nothing at all of any ſuch thing: but he diſowns all Epiſtles which affirm that the End of the World is at hand.

               <p n="2">2. The Declaration which he makes upon it, is accompanied with ſome Circumſtances which preſent us with a new Demonſtration. After he had removed from the Minds of the <hi>Theſſalomans</hi> the Error that was crept in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong 'em under his Name, he marks out the Events which are to forerun the End of the World. <hi>Let no man,</hi> ſays he, <hi>deceive you by any means;</hi>

                  <hi>for that day ſhall not come, except

But to give ſome plauſible Colour to his Conjecture, he muſt have antidated ſeveral years the Second E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians;</hi> which the Learned Men of both Communions have all alike diſlik'd.</p>
               <p>Beſides this Conſideration which is of great moment, I add, that <hi>Grotius</hi> goes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout to bereave S. <hi>Paul</hi> of ſound Judgment, in making him argue thus. The laſt day is a great way off, be you aſſuredly convinc'd of it: for it ſhall not appear till you have ſeen <hi>Caius Caligula</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> If thoſe Men of Sin were then juſt ready to break forth into all their Impieties, as muſt be granted according to <hi>Grotius</hi>'s Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteme, how could they have any ſhare in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Argument, whoſe intention it was to ſhew, that the Day of Judgment was far remote.</p>
               <p>S. <hi>Paul,</hi> had not ſeen yet all the Events, which according to his knowledge, were to precede the End of the World. Did he not know that <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was to be deſtroy'd; that the Gentiles ſhould receive
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:98516:74"/>the Goſpel, and that the Jews ſhould reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver from their loſt Condition? Theſe are Truths which are diſperſed up and down in S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Epiſtles. Had he had no other Lights but thoſe of common Senſe, he would have ſeen that thoſe Events and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions were not at hand, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that the End of the World was not ſo near, before which thoſe Revolutions were to happen.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the ſame Chapter we meet with Expreſſions which are the Ground of another Argument, which is no leſs ſtrong than the two former. I undertake to prove by S. <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, that he neither believ'd nor taught, that the End of the World was at hand. Is it not a certain proof of this ſame Truth, that in the ſame place, where the Apoſtle denies the End of the World to be at hand, he engages the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> to perſevere in the Doctrine that had been taught 'em both by Writing, and by Word of Mouth? Inſtead of telling 'em, I was deceiv'd in my Firſt Epiſtle, but I have received New Lights about the Time that the World ſhall come to an End, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore do not believe what I ſaid: he ſpeaks quite another Language. <hi>Therefore Brethren,</hi> ſays he, <hi>ſtand faſt, and hold the Traditions which ye have been taught whether by Word or our Epiſtle.</hi> Is this the Stile of a Man that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants?</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Argument which they would have S. <hi>Paul</hi> to make, by imputing to him about the near Approach of the World, drives on
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:98516:74"/>ſo far, as to maintain, that this Apoſtle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd he ſhould not die. <hi>Then we which are alive and remain ſhall be caught up together with them in the Clouds,</hi> &amp;c. To urge home the Literal Signification of theſe Words, they ſay, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ranks himſelf in the Number of thoſe, who, without ſeeing Death, ſhall be chang'd. Now how can it be ſaid, that he believ'd himſelf exempt from Death; he who ſpeaks ſo frequently of his Death in his Epiſtles. He had always Martyrdom be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his Eyes. In the <hi>Acts, And now behold,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I go bound in the ſpirit unto</hi> Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, <hi>not knowing the things that ſhall befal me there; ſaving that the Holy Ghoſt witneſſes in every City, that Bonds and Afflictions abide me. But none of theſe things move me, neither count I my Life dear unto my ſelf, ſo that I might finiſh my courſe with joy.</hi> The ſame Apoſtle thus expreſſes himſelf to the <hi>Philippians, So now Chriſt ſhall be magnified in my body, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be by Life or by death.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Philip. 1.20.</note> 
                  <hi>For me to live is Chriſt, and to die is gain.</hi> Could this be the Language of a Man who thought he ſhould not die? Since then it appears, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> knew he ſhould die, it muſt be concluded, that he never thought himſelf to be of the Number of thoſe that were perſonally to be chang'd without taſting Death. This is an Argument of S. <hi>Jerome</hi> upon this Occaſion.<note place="margin">Neque enim fieri poteſt, ut qui ad Timotheum ſcripſerat.

               <p n="5">5. <hi>Grotius,</hi> to ſave S. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Honor or rather his own, would fain have what S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays in the Firſt to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> to paſs for a bare Conjecture; and puts it in the number of thoſe <hi>It may be's,</hi> of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes uſe when he ſpeaks of ſome of his Journies. 'Tis no great wonder to ſee, that an Apoſtle, fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Motion of his Reaſon, or his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, ſhould hope to undertake thoſe Journies which he did not do. In that he tells no Untruth, he only ſpeaks things as he thinks; ſo that while he abides and heſitates in a bare expectation under the good pleaſure of God, there is nothing to be laid to his Charge. But what is there in common with theſe Examples, and the Myſtery which S. <hi>Paul</hi> conſtantly teaches, touching the Change of thoſe that ſhall be alive at the laſt day?</p>
               <p>Upon this I obſerve two Diſtinctions; the one as to the Matter, the others as to the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

               <p>The Second Diſtinction relates to the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; as to which, there only wants a little Attention, that they do ill in this place to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge Conjectures which might eſcape S. <hi>Paul</hi>
                  <pb n="139" facs="tcp:98516:75"/>in reference to Journeys only in Thought, and in order to which, he poſitively ſays, <hi>If the Lord permit.</hi> Firſt therefore, when he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes of the Change of the Living, he treats of it as a Myſtery. Now what ſhall the Apoſtles learn from the Holy Ghoſt, if not Myſteries? <hi>Behold, I tell you a Myſtery; all ſhall not ſleep, but all ſhall be chang'd.</hi> This is not ſaid with an Air of Conjecture. <hi>Behold, I tell you a Myſtery: I would not, that you ſhould be ignorant,</hi> ſays he to the <hi>Theſſalonians.</hi> This is ſtill very affirmative. 2. We ought to obſerve with what great Care S. <hi>Paul</hi> handles this Myſtery. <hi>We tell you this, by the Word of the Lord.</hi> Let 'em not ſay then, that this is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture ſprung up in the Mind of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> He declares, that he has no ſhare in it, but that it is a Revelation of the Lord. If it were not ſo, S. <hi>Paul</hi> impos'd upon the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> and there is not that Sincerity in him which <hi>M.N.</hi> admits in the Apoſtles. The ſame Author al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo agrees, that what they declar'd to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from the Lord, was effectually the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of divine Revelation. It was then from that, S. <hi>Paul</hi> receiv'd what he ſays of the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery of the Change at the laſt day. So that Criticiſms which they raiſe upon this Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine would fall upon our Lord himſelf, were they built upon any good Foundation.</p>
               <p>After theſe Five Conſiderations, 'tis im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to impute to S. <hi>Paul</hi> any Change of Opinion, in reference to the near approach of the World's End; or that he deny'd in his Second Epiſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> what he had taught 'em in his Firſt upon this Subject.
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:98516:76"/>But they cloſely urge the manner of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing himſelf, <hi>We which are alive and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main ſhall be caught up together in the Clouds.</hi> It has manifeſtly appear'd by what I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready ſet down, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> did not believe he ſhould abide in this World till that great Revolution he ſpeaks of. Why then does he ſay, <hi>We which are alive?</hi> 'Tis clear, that it ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies no more, than <hi>They among the faithful, who ſhall be alive at that time. Grotius</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf quotes divers Examples wherein S. <hi>Paul</hi> aſſumes to his own Perſon what he would ſay of others; and calls this Figure <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>. Conſult him upon the Seventh Chapter of the Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the Second of the <hi>Epheſians.</hi> Why does he not admit the ſame Figure in this, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays in reference to thoſe that ſhall be alive at the laſt Day? 'Tis ſay they, becauſe there is no Occaſion for this Figure, but when the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute is about Vices and Virtues: but 'tis plain, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> took an occaſion to make another uſe of it, and that there is a neceſſity that his meaning ſhould be ſo. He ſpeaks in ſeveral places, as a Man fully convinc'd, that he ſhould die: nevertheleſs in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. he ſays, <hi>We ſhall not all ſleep,</hi> that is to ſay, we ſhall not all die. There is no reconciling him to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but by ſaying, that it is by a Figure, that he puts himſelf in the number of thoſe that ſhall not die. They who duly conſider his manner of ſpeaking of the intimate Union of the Faithful, make no wonder to ſee him attribute to himſelf the Advantage which the Faithful ſhall receive at the laſt day. All the
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:98516:76"/>Faithful according to the Doctrine of this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle make but one glorious Body under one glorious Head; whatever befalls the one, whether Good or Evil, is the Concern of the whole Body: we are Priſoners with the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners; we are whatever the Faithful are; we are ſeated in Heaven with thoſe who are there already; we ſhall live in thoſe that ſhall ſurvive at the laſt day. The Figure is bold, it may be for a common Style, but it naturally agrees with thoſe Ideas of which S. <hi>Paul</hi> was full, in reference to the Union of the Faithful. By means of this Explanation, 'tis eaſie to ſee that he never thought himſelf exempt from death; and that what he ſays in the Firſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> no way contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicts what he teaches in the Second. Let it then be allow'd for certain, that this Example is no Obſtruction, but that this A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle and his Colleagues were infallibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by the Holy Ghoſt. But it behoves us to return to thoſe things that are only Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitants of the Doctrine, and ſee whether the Infallibility of the Apoſtles went ſo far.</p>

               <head>
                  <hi>CHAP VIII.</hi> Wherein is examined what influence the Direction of the Holy Ghoſt had over thoſe things that were only Concomitants of the Doctrine.</head>
               <p>I Call Concomitants of the Doctrine cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain things, which without making any part of the Evangelical Doctrine, are join'd with it nevertheleſs, for Illuſtration ſake, or for ſome other Reaſon; as Proverbs, the particular affairs of the Apoſtles, Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, or if there be any thing elſe of the ſame Nature.</p>
               <p>As for Proverbs, S. <hi>Paul</hi> cites one, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der more ſenſibly perſpicuous what he had ſpoken concerning the miſery of Relapſes. <hi>But it is happen'd unto them according to the true Proverb, the Dog is returned to his Vomit again.</hi> Such is that moral Maxim which S. <hi>Paul</hi> Cites in the Epiſtle to the <hi>Corinthians, Evil Company corrupts good Manners.</hi> Now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Principles that I have already ſet down, theſe Paſſages were not inſpir'd but laid by way of Direction. We are not to ſeek for any other Infallibility of the Proverbs quoted by the Sacred Authors, than that of Aim and Deſign, which conſiſts only in the applications and Conſequences. Though a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:98516:77"/>theſe Proverbs, there ſhould be any one that it would be a hard matter to make good (which however I make it not my Buſineſs to examin) the Authority of the Holy Ghoſt would be in no danger for all that, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the uſe made of it were good, and the Conſequence true. That ſuffices to keep up the Honor of the direction of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>I ſpeak not here of Philoſophic Notions: for I do not find that the Holy Ghoſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted the Apoſtles to make any uſe of 'em; though it may be ſuppoſed that they might have learn'd ſome by Hearſay; and for that St. <hi>Paul</hi> had ſtudied at <hi>Tarſus</hi> and <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> that is to ſay, in the Schools where Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy was in requeſt. A <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Author,<note place="margin">Vales de ſac. Phil.</note> who has diligently over-run the whole Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to take notice of ſuch Paſſages, wherein it aſſerts ſome Phyſical Truth, obſerves no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the Apoſtolic Writings, unleſs it be what Saint <hi>Peter</hi> ſpeaks of the diſſolution of the Elements at the laſt day. But this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, wherein it is clear that the thing in diſpute is about a reveal'd Doctrine, has no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in common with natural Philoſophy, neither does it hinder us from aſſerting, that the Apoſtles religiouſly abſtain'd from touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon natural Queſtions. The Holy Ghoſt had no deſign to make them Maſters of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy.</p>
               <p>We find in the Writings of the Apoſtles that they ſpeak ſometimes of their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular affairs, as when S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſends for his Cloak and his Parchmins. Now upon thoſe the Direction of the Holy Ghoſt is no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:98516:78"/>concern'd than to take care that the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles write nothing indecent, and what is contrary to ſound Sence. When their Pens confin'd themſelves within theſe Bounds, he let them alone: but if it went aſtray, he took care to reduce it. We may expect from this direction, that when theſe Holy men wrote any thing concerning their own affairs, they ſhould let nothing eſcape them unworthy the Gravity of the firſt Miniſters of the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>There is a little more ſcruple to be made in reference to Quotations, and ſome ſlight Circumſtances of matters of Fact, related in the New Teſtament. Some think that the Apoſtles were ſometimes miſtaken in both theſe Caſes; yet without any injury to the infallibility of things in reſpect of their main and moſt important Verity. I muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, that the Apoſtles might be mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken in the Quotations of Authors, or in Circumſtances of little importance, and yet that no ſolid argument can be drawn from thence againſt the Fundamental truth of their Hiſtory. But I find nothing ſtrong enough to oblige me to agree that theſe ſorts of Errors are to be met with in the Apoſtolic Writings. I have great reaſon ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to believe that the Holy Ghoſt, one of whoſe cares it was to corroborate the Memory of the Apoſtles, would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to be defective in the exerciſe of a Faculty which he undertook to ſtrengthen. I cannot imagin that a Spirit which had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich'd the Apoſtles with ſuch excellent Gifts,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:98516:78"/>would abandon his Miniſters upon ſuch an occaſion. Such a Deſertion would have been of greater Conſequence that it appears to be. For though in the Opinion of men of Judgement, ſlight Faults are no way pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the Doctrine of the Goſpel, yet conſidering the great variety of mens Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors and Diſpoſitions, ſuch ſlips make very untoward impreſſions. Let us ſuppoſe, that the Apoſtles in citing the Authors of the Old Teſtament, ſhould have quoted <hi>Moſes</hi> inſtead of <hi>Joſhuah, David</hi> inſtead of <hi>Solomon,</hi> or that they had made a confuſion among the Names of the Prophets: Let us ſuppoſe that theſe Holy men had contradicted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the relation of the Circumſtances of all the Evangelical matters of Fact; would not this have imprinted into the <hi>Jews</hi> a ſtrange Idea of the Apoſtles, an Idea ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to have utterly ruin'd the Grand deſign of the Goſpel. Now in regard it behoves us to be convinc'd that it was the intention of the Holy Ghoſt to labour the propagation of the Goſpel by the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles, 'tis no leſs evident in my Opinion that the wiſe Director did not relinquiſh them to any ſuch diſorder.</p>
               <p>Theſe Conſiderations are not well weigh'd in the minds of ſome Authors, no more than the Examples which they cite. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide <hi>M. N.</hi> has picked up all the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors he could think of to ſupport his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment touching the faults of memory which he attributes to the Apoſtles. But all this Enquiry could produce no more than three
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:98516:79"/>or four Authors, <hi>viz.</hi> St. <hi>Jerome, Eraſmus, Epiſcopius</hi> and <hi>Capel.</hi> Upon which I ſhall make ſeveral Obſervations, that bereave <hi>M. N.</hi> of all the advantage which he reaps by the uſe he makes of thoſe Authors.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Let us a little examin the nature of of their Teſtimony. We are not to reckon that of Saint <hi>Jerome;</hi> for <hi>M.

               <p>As for <hi>Eraſmus</hi> I have very near the ſame thing to ſay of him that <hi>M.

<pb n="148" facs="tcp:98516:80"/>it manifeſt that <hi>Epiſcopius</hi> had much ado to be of <hi>M. N</hi>'s Opinion Neither does <hi>Capel</hi> ſpeak more affirmatively upon this Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject. And thus you ſee what heed we ought to give to the Quotations that are produced againſt us.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Queſtion were to be decided by Authority; <hi>M. N.</hi> knows well that it would not turn to his account. He acknowledges that he has a Croud of leaned men againſt him, whoſe authority he neglects. <hi>I do not believe my ſelf,</hi> ſays he, <hi>obliged to ſubmit to the Authority of a Croud of learned Men, who do but repeat the ſame things over and over a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, without ever having examin'd them, or without producing any Reaſon for what they ſay.</hi> Are we more oblig'd to ſubmit to <hi>M. N</hi>'s Learned men, than he to ours? Let him but only remember as to this particular, that his Learned men are reduc'd to one or two at moſt, and that we have all the reſt of our ſide. So that if the Diſpute were to be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried by Authority, the Conteſt would ſoon be at an end.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs I would not abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the advantage which we draw from the Conſent of ſo many learned men; but not to inſiſt too much upon their Teſtimony, I would willingly agree, that ſetting all Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority aſide, the Queſtion might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd to the very bottom. And this is that which I have done, by ſhewing that there is no likelihood that the Holy Ghoſt ever intended to leſſen the Reputation of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, by permitting them to fall into the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:98516:80"/>defects of Memory, though they were never ſo ſlight.</p>
               <p>I ſhould lookupon the Objection which is drawn from Examples to be of greater force, were they well grounded. I will not here enter into a particular examination of the paſſages upon which the Enemies of Chriſtianity build their Pretences, that the Apoſtles ſtumbled into Contradictions for want of memory. I ſhall only pick out two the moſt ſeemingly apparent Contradictions, and they ſhall be thoſe that <hi>M. N.</hi> has mark'd out himſelf. The one is, that S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> relating the ſtory of <hi>Judas</hi>'s Treachery ſeems to miſtake <hi>Jeremy</hi> for <hi>Zachary:</hi> The other relates to the manner of the Traytors death.</p>
               <p>There is nothing to hinder us from affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, upon occaſion of theſe two Examples, but that it might ſo happen that the greateſt part of the pretended Errors, which are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> ought rather to be charged upon the Copyers of the Books, than upon the Apoſtles. The Sacred Books were originally without Blemiſh; and this per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection extended it ſelf even to things of leaſt moment. If it be ſaid, that Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, whoſe cares are conſtant for the ſubſtance of Religion, did afterwards per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit that the Scripture ſhould ſuffer by the Hands of <hi>Amanuenſes</hi> in reſpect of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain petty things, wherein Religion was no way concern'd, yet the work of the Holy Ghoſt is ſecur'd, and is no way liable to the difficulties we meet with in ſome parts of the Scriptures. The faults of Copyers
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:98516:81"/>or Printers ought not to do any prejudice to the Original, which formerly was deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth by thoſe Infallible Hands which the Holy Ghoſt directed.</p>
               <p>But there is no need of bringing this An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Providence hath guarded the Holy Scripture, ſo that after a ſlight examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Scruples vaniſh. There is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite for that, no more than ſuch an Examen, as is neceſſary for Common Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors to avoid the Laſhes of Criticiſm. And now I ſhall demonſtrate this Truth in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to the two Examples which I have produc'd by way of Objection. VVe don't beg here for any favour, though ſuch a matter, wherein remoteneſs of Time, when ſeveral Circumſtances were known, whereby the Scripture was more intelligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and which are loſt for us, would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that we ſhould not exerciſe the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity of Criticiſin with too much Rigor.</p>

But though the miſtake be of little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; I believe the Sacred Writer ought to be juſtified, and it is eaſie to do it in a few words.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:98516:81"/>
               <p>There are ſeveral Methods that Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters make uſe of, to ſhew that Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> was not miſtaken. The greateſt part are very good; I ſhall produce thoſe which ſeem to me to be the beſt. For brevities ſake, I confine my ſelf to ſome few. I begin with the learned <hi>Lightfoot,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Hor. heb. in loc.</note> who proves by the <hi>Talmud</hi> and by <hi>Kinchi,</hi> that <hi>Jeremy</hi> was the running Title of the reſt of the Prophets in one and the ſame Volume. Whence it came to paſs, that in the anſwer which the Diſciples gave our Lord, <hi>Jeremy</hi> is the chiefeſt Prophet. <hi>Some ſay thou art John the Baptiſt; Others Eliah; Others Jeremy.</hi> Which being ſo, all the Prophets were cited under the name of <hi>Jeremy.</hi> He bequeath'd his Name, as I may ſo ſay, to the whole Volume, in like manner as the Volume of the <hi>Hagio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graphers</hi> is call'd the <hi>Pſalms of David,</hi> becauſe that <hi>Davids</hi> Pſalms make up the firſt part of the Volume. So that according to this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation, Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> did but follow the common Cuſtom, in citing the words of <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary</hi> under <hi>Jeremy</hi>'s name.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Grotius,</hi> quoted by <hi>M. N.</hi> to authorize the defects which he imputes to the memory of the Apoſtles, makes no uſe of this means to free Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> from the Scandal thrown up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him. He very judiciouſly obſerves, that Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> does not ſay that <hi>Jeremy</hi> wrote the words which he attributes to him. <hi>Then was fulfilled what the Prophet Jeremy had ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi> Theſe words are not to be found in <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and conſequently he never wrote 'em. He had only pronounced them, and they
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:98516:82"/>were preſerved by Tradition, from whence <hi>Zachary</hi> took them. <hi>Grotius,</hi> to make out his Opinion, proves that the Prophets common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made uſe of the ſame words which other Prophets had left behind them; and that <hi>Zachary</hi> in particular ſtrives to imitate <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy;</hi> ſo that the <hi>Jews</hi> were accuſtomed to ſay, that the Spirit of <hi>Jeremy</hi> was upon <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chary.</hi> And then according to this Expoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> makes <hi>Jeremy</hi> to ſay no more than what he ſaid indeed.</p>
               <p>I ſhall add another, wherein ſtill farther ſatisfaction may be met with, if one of the two former does not ſatisfie. Saint <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſays, that the Holy Ghoſt ſuffered the name of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> and not that of <hi>Zachary</hi> to drop upon the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> Pen; and that Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> was unwilling to correct himſelf, as being perſuaded, that the deſign of the Holy Ghoſt was to ſhew that all the Prophets ſpoke by the ſame Spirit: <hi>Singula eſſe omnium, &amp; om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia ſingulorum;</hi> all the Prophetic Writings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long'd in common to all the Prophets. But this Explanation ſeems to me a little too much forc'd: and therefore I could more willingly aſſent to another which is to be found in the ſame place. That the words which S. <hi>Matthew</hi> reports,<note place="margin">Cum igitur ea quae dicta ſunt per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<pb n="153" facs="tcp:98516:82"/>this Explanation, ſeveral Examples are cited, wherein an Oracle, compos'd of words drawn from two different Prophets, is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledg'd under the name of one only. In a word, there are ſeveral Copies of the New Teſtament, wherein the ſecond Verſe of the Goſpel according to Saint <hi>Mark</hi> is thus ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, according as it is written in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> though the words are drawn from both <hi>Iſaiah</hi> and <hi>Malachy.</hi> So that the Oracle of Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> being taken part out of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> part out of <hi>Zachary,</hi> 'tis no wonder that only one Prophet ſhould be ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and <hi>Jeremy</hi> before the other.</p>
               <p>There is another Conjecture which Great Authors have made uſe of,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>L.</hi> 4. <hi>Ep.</hi> 31.</note> I mean <hi>Mede</hi> and <hi>Hammon.</hi> The firſt has encloſed in one Epiſtle ſeveral ſcruples like to thoſe which I exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min. He ſays that Saint <hi>Matthews</hi> intention in citing the words in queſtion under the name of <hi>Jeremy,</hi> was to let us underſtand that the Chapter where thoſe words are found was really written by <hi>Jeremy:</hi> and adds, that if we exactly conſider the Contents of the nine, ten, and eleven Chapters of <hi>Zachary,</hi> we ſhall find, that they were written before the time of that Prophet. The Eleventh Chapter, which is that quoted by S. <hi>Matthew,</hi> foretels the deſtruction of the Temple, which no way agrees with <hi>Zacharies</hi> time, when the main Buſineſs of the Prophets was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort the <hi>Jews</hi> to rebuild the Temple. For this reaſon, among others, <hi>Mede</hi> maintains that the laſt Chapters of <hi>Zachary</hi> were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by ſome Prophet more ancient than he;
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:98516:83"/>which Prophet could be no other than <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remy;</hi> ſeeing Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> aſſures us of it, and for that we find nothing to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary in any part of Scripture. It would be in vain to alledge that thoſe Chapters are join'd to the Prophecies of <hi>Zachary.</hi> That argument is of no greater force than if they ſhould go about to prove that the whole Book of Pſalms was written by <hi>David,</hi> or the whole Book of <hi>Proverbs</hi> by <hi>Solomon,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they go under their Names.</p>
               <p>They muſt be very ſcrupulous that will not be ſatisfied with one of theſe Solutions: I am perſuaded they will ſatisfie any man that is not reſolv'd whatever it coſt him, to maintain that Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> was deceiv'd. 'Tis now time therefore to paſs to the ſecond Example, which they make uſe of to ſhew, that the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> contradicted one another for want of Memory.</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.5.</note> in the ſame place tells us, that <hi>Judas,</hi> after <hi>he had caſt down the pieces of Silver, departed, and went and hang'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi> But Saint <hi>Luke</hi> ſeems to obſerve that this miſerable Wretch periſhed by another ſort of death. <hi>For,</hi> ſays he, <hi>And falling headlong he burſt aſunder,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Acts</hi> 1.18.</note> 
                  <hi>and all his Bowels guſhed out.</hi> Now they pretend, that in this the two Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Authors have contradicted each other. <hi>M. N.</hi> loudly triumphs upon it, as if there were no anſwer to be given to it. <hi>There,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is a manifeſt Contradiction, which the Learned in vain endeavour to reconcile.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> p. 235.</note> Let us ſee whether it be ſo apparent as he would make us believe.</p>
               <pb n="155" facs="tcp:98516:83"/>
               <p>By admitting the Contradiction, 'tis to be ſuppos'd, that one of the two <hi>Evangeliſts,</hi> was deficient in his memory. Muſt it be Saint <hi>Matthew?</hi> How! one of the Twelve, one of <hi>Judas</hi>'s Colleagues, could he forget how <hi>Judas</hi> died? This is that which no body will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to affirm; I ſhould almoſt rather chuſe to ſay, that the Apoſtles forgot what kind of death Chriſt Jeſus died. The death of <hi>Judas</hi> was an Accident ſo conſiderable and ſo extraordinary, that they could not but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member it; will they ſay that Saint <hi>Luke</hi> was deceived? How could that be? He wrote under the Inſpection of the Apoſtles concerning a notorious Accident. <hi>That,</hi> ſays he, <hi>which was known to all the Inhabitants of Jeruſalem.</hi> Doubtleſs he had read the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel of Saint <hi>Matthew,</hi> whom he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be a teſtimony of ſufficient Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit. After which, would he, in common ſence, have undertaken to contradict ſuch a Teſtimony? By theſe Reflexions it appears, that it is impoſſible, that either of the two <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> ſhould have been deceived. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs one ſays, that <hi>Judas</hi> hang'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the other that he threw himſelf head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. But eaſie ſatisfaction may be given upon this ſeeming Contradiction.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Nothing hinders the reconciling theſe two Idea's, by ſaying that <hi>Judas</hi> hang'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf upon ſome high place, but that the Rope broke, which was the reaſon, that his Body falling headlong, he burſt himſelf, and his Bowels guſh'd out; this is very poſſible. In this the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> agree perfectly. One
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:98516:84"/>ſays, what the other ſays not; but they do not contradict themſelves. Therefore <hi>M. N.</hi> is in the wrong to aſſure us with ſo much confidence, that it is a manifeſt Contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
               <p n="2">2. 'Tis known that there is a difference between hanging and ſtrangling a mans ſelf. <hi>Judas</hi> might ſtrangle himſelf and yet not hang himſelf. <hi>Hammon</hi> and other good Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors ſay, that upon this occaſion, Grief did the Office of a Hangman, and proves by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Examples that men have been ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled with Grief, that is to ſay, that they were choked by intercepting the paſſage of the Spirits. The original <hi>Greek</hi> word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies no more. Let us ſay then, that this Accident befell <hi>Judas</hi> in ſome High place, from whence his Body falling might burſt out.</p>
               <p n="3">3. I ought not to forget a third Opinion, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to which the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gled himſelf,</hi> includes not the death of <hi>Judas,</hi> but barely an extream Grief. As if a man ſhould ſay, though he did not die at the ſame time, <hi>I am ſtifl'd with Grief,</hi> only to expreſs a conſiderable degree of anguiſh of mind. In the Book of <hi>Tobit,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Tob. <hi>3.12.</hi> vid. Ham. in Matth. <hi>27.5.</hi>
                  </note> there is an expreſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of it. We find the Daughter of <hi>Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guel</hi> ſo terribly griev'd with the Reproaches that were caſt upon her <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>ſo that ſhe thought to have ſtrangled her ſelf.</hi> However ſhe did not die, as appears by the ſequel of the Hiſtory. Thus it was, ſay they, that <hi>Judas</hi> was ſurpriz'd by his Grief, he did not die preſently, but ſome days after he
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:98516:84"/>went and threw himſelf headlong in the height of that Rage which attends people in in deſpair. Saint <hi>Matthew</hi> ſpeaks of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Grief of <hi>Judas:</hi> Saint <hi>Luke</hi> of his Death: there is no contradiction. After theſe three Explanations, can a man with ſo much confidence affirm, <hi>that 'tis a mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Contradiction which the Learned in vain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to reconcile?</hi> Muſt he not have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd open War againſt the Sacred Writers, to call this <hi>a manifeſt Contradiction?</hi> I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to all Perſons of Juſtice and Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, whether it does not appear by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner after which the Anſwers are made to both Examples, that they are not ſufficient to prove that the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> contradicted themſelves or were deceived, even in things of little Importance?</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein it appears what ought to be the Extent of the ſignification of the words which the Sacred Writers have made uſe of in the Writings of the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Have diſtinguiſh'd thoſe things which the Holy Ghoſt immediately ſuggeſted to the Apoſtless from thoſe wherein he only preſided by way of Direction. They would not make any Scruple to grant, that the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification of the Expreſſions dictated by the Holy Ghoſt are to be taken in a full ſence, but 'tis pretended that there is no need of being ſo exact in thoſe that may be called the product of Human Wit. <hi>M. N.</hi> cannot brook, there ſhould be any ſearch made after the Reaſons why the Holy Ghoſt made uſe of one word rather than another, and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains that it is Ridiculous; becauſe often the Language of the Sacred Authors is Human, and Careleſs enough. The ordinary Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod hath as he thinks a grear affinity with the Opinion of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who hold it for a Maxim, that the Books of the Law are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired even to a Letter:<note place="margin">Defence des ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim. <hi>pag. 235.</hi> lett. <hi>9.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>There is not one Letter in the Law,</hi> ſay they, <hi>upon which great Mountains do not depend.</hi> He alledges the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of the <hi>Antecedent</hi> Imputation of the
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:98516:85"/>Sin of <hi>Adam,</hi> which is grounded upon a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon that S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes uſe of. that <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon,</hi> ſays he, <hi>is taken in a rigid ſence, whereas it ſhould be conſider'd, that the Style of S.</hi> Paul <hi>being the Style of a man, who is not exact in his expreſſions, though the ground of his Arguments are to be admir'd. Now to be ſo nice about the full ſignification of all his Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions would expoſe one to a world of miſtakes.</hi> I am glad he acknowledges that the grounds of S. <hi>Pauls</hi> Arguments are to be admir'd. Were the Author hard put to it, I queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther he would not enervate this Confeſſion with ſome diſtinction. But that we may exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min what he ſays concerning thoſe who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt too ſeverely upon the Sacred Language of the authors of the New Teſtament, I think it neceſſary to obſerve two Things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That by this ſort of Divinity, they an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nihilate the uſe of the Sacred Books. They will make them ſpeak whatever they think fit. Who does not plainly ſee, that if they can make us believe, that the Sacred Authors wrote things without exactneſs, there muſt be a door open'd for all manner of Errors? Though I ſet down a Truth which I might ſupport upon words that ſeem clear to me, they will preſently diſpute it with me, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they may tell me there is no exactneſs in the Terms; You deceive your ſelf by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fining your thought to the meaning of the words. This is awonderful Rampart for all manner of Heretics. Had the Holy Ghoſt abandon'd the Holy Writers to ſuch a Neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence,
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:98516:86"/>I ſhould believe that his deſign was to have made the Scripture a Nurſery of Errors and Diviſions, and not a Nurſery of Truth.</item>
                  <item>2. That although the Style of the Sacred Authors be Human, it cannot be ſaid to be Careleſs in reſpect of Things: we know that there are Careleſs Expreſſions which Grammar would never pardon. The Holy Ghoſt had no deſign to make the Apoſtles Maſters of Language: his aim was only to inſtruct them in the Truth; provided they ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd it Intelligible, that was ſufficient. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this ſuppoſition 'tis plain, that we ought not to take the Language of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles for a Model of pure <hi>Greek;</hi> that was never the deſign of the Holy Ghoſt. But ſince it is certain that he made them intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible, 'tis our Duty to receive with ſubmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion all the Truths which he has permitted the Apoſtles to wrap up in a common Style. The Holy Ghoſt has not ſuffered them to write any thing but what was true. 'Tis our Duty to ſearch after what they have ſaid, and to rely upon thoſe Truths which they have taught us under the direction of the Holy Ghoſt.</item>
               </list>
               <p>To which purpoſe there is no neceſſity of admitting that all is inſpired in the New T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ſtament, to a Letter, as the <hi>Jews</hi> affirm concerning their Law; and that Great Mountains depend upon every Letter. By this Proverb the <hi>Jews</hi> mean <hi>Inſpiration</hi> by ſuggeſtion. I have ſhewed that all that we
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:98516:86"/>read in the New Teſtament was far from being inſpir'd after that manner, but that the greateſt part was the work of the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles under the Direction of the Holy Ghoſt, who would not ſuffer them to fall into any Error. In that, our Divinity no way reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles that of the <hi>Jews.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We do not pretend as they do that Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains depend upon every Letter. They make every thing to be Myſterious in their Cabaliſtical Science. This is not our <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius:</hi> nor do we approve the Method of ſome Chriſtians who turn all the Scripture into Allegories; but while we avoid that exceſs which would make the Miniſters of the Holy Ghoſt to ſpeak what they never thought, we are careful not to fall into t' o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther extream, <hi>viz.</hi> to reject what they both ſaid and thought. We make a diligent ſearch after the true meaning of the Terms which they make uſe of. And when we have found out their true and Genuine Sence, we ſubmit to their Deciſion, as if the Holy Ghoſt had ſpoken to us. Whatever they have told us by his direction, may it not paſs for the real Declaration of his Will? When I explain a Scripture compos'd by his Order and direction, to that degree of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection as we enjoy it, I think really that I explain the Voice of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>

                  <p>Wherein ſome Objections are anſwered, which have no Relation to the Apoſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Writings.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>
                  <hi>SPinoſa</hi> and <hi>M. N.</hi> have endeavoured by various Objections to overturn the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the Sacred Books of the New Teſtament; but ſeeing thoſe Authors only oppoſe a ſort of Inſpiration which we admit not, it ſignifies nothing to us. Now the main Foundation upon which <hi>M. N.</hi> builds his Objections, is this: <hi>'Tis believ'd in the firſt place, that the Things themſelves were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed by Inſpiration into the Sacred Hiſtorians, and afterwards the Terms wherein they are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd. In a word, the Sacred Hiſtory was dictated word for word by the Holy Ghoſt; and that the Authors, whoſe Names are affix'd to it, were, as it were his Secretaries, that wrote ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:98516:87"/>as he dictated.</hi> Upon this Foundation it is, that <hi>M. N.</hi> rears his Objections. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they don't concern us, who admit no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than an Inſpiration of Direction, in things which it was not neceſſary that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould ſuggeſt to the Apoſtles. Having made this Obſervation, I might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; for I have anſwered every thing in explaining the Nature of the Inſpiration of the Sacred Books. But the better to make it appear, that all their Objections can do my Syſtem no harm, I ſhall propoſe them in few Words.</p>
               <p>I ſhall divide theſe Objections into two Claſſes, to the end my Anſwer may be the more orderly and methodical. There are ſome which are drawn from the Behaviour of the Apoſtles upon certain Occaſions that have no relation to the Sacred Writings. The other are deriv'd from the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings themſelves. Thoſe of the firſt Rank, ſo far as I can remember, are, That S. <hi>Peter</hi> doubts about the Admiſſion of the Gentiles into the Chriſtian Church. That the ſame Apoſtle diſſembled with the Jews, for which he was deſervedly contradicted by S. <hi>Paul.</hi> That S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaid of the High Prieſt, that he knew him not: and that at another time he divided the Opinions of his Judges by a peice of prudential Policy, which was altogether human. From all which 'tis concluded, that they were not inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red.</p>
               <p>'Tis quite out of the Subject I have in hand to inſiſt upon theſe Objections; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:98516:88"/>I have only undertaken to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of the Inſpiration of the Sacred Books. The Queſtion is not to examin whether the Apoſtles were inſpired as to every thing they ſaid or did; my Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment extends no farther than their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings; thoſe Writings which Providence preſerv'd for the Inſtructions of Chriſtians in all Ages. It might be, that the Holy Ghoſt might leave the Apoſtles to themſelves, upon divers Occaſions, yet that could be no prejudice to thoſe Writings, upon which, by the appointment of the Almighty, our Faith and Salvation depend. Nor is it impoſſible, but that the Apoſtles in their firſt Motions, might both ſay and think things which were not ſupported by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>Nor ſhould I much oppoſe Divines, who would thereby explain what the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles ſaid, when they heard that S. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> whom they thought to be in Priſon, was at Liberty.<note place="margin">A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>t 12.15.</note> 
                  <hi>It is his Angel.</hi> There is no Ground for the Opinion of a Guardian Angel to be deduc'd from thoſe Words: for beſides, that the Words might have been ſpoken by ſome Chriſtians in the ſame Room, who were not Apoſtles (which one would eaſily think upon theſe Words of the Hiſtorian, <hi>where ſeveral were aſſembled together to pray</hi>) beſides that I ſay, altho it might be prov'd, that the Words were ſpoken by the Apoſtles, that ſhould be aſcribed to their Amazement, that would not be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient to ſupport ſuch a Belief. If at any time where the Apoſtles were not employ'd
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:98516:88"/>in the Functions of their Miniſtery, they ſeem'd to act like Men, there is no Inference to be drawn from thence, as to what they acted as Apoſtles. Under this Quality they were the Miniſters of the Holy Ghoſt in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing which they did; and as ſuch they were infallible.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Spinoſa</hi> acknowledges that the Apoſtles were inſpired in their Preaching,<note place="margin">Conoludimns ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que Apoſtolos ea tantum ex ſingulari revelatione habuiſſe, quae viva voce prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicaverunt, &amp; ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mul ſignis confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verunt. <hi>Spin. Tract. Theol. Polit. c. 11. par. 1.</hi>
                  </note> but not in their Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, which are a kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Preaching. But if we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare theſe two ſorts of Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I muſt needs ſay, that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration was much more neceſſary for the Scripture, the uſe of which is perpetual, than for Tranſitory Sermons, and Preaching accompanied with ſeveral Advantages which the Scripture has not.</p>
               <p>The Diſpute at preſent is not about Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolick Preaching, much leſs about things which the Apoſtles either ſaid or did when they were not employ'd in the Functions of their Miniſtry. So that all the Objections which are drawn from thence no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Queſtion which we have now in hand, I mean the Inſpiration of the Sacred Writings. Yet ſomething muſt be ſaid to theſe Objections for fear one ſhould think they are unanſwerable. 'Tis ſaid, that S. <hi>Peter</hi> doubted for ſome time concerning the Admiſſion of the Gentiles into the Chriſtian Church, and they conclude from thence, that he was not inſpired. Now if we ſhould maintain that
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:98516:89"/>the Inſpiration of the Apoſtles was infus'd all of a ſudden, and that upon the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> the Holy Ghoſt declar'd to 'em all thoſe Truths which they were to promulgate, this Objection might be of ſome force. But ſince we only ſay, that the Holy Ghoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed the Apoſtles by degrees, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as he found it expedient, there is nothing ſolid in the Objection.</p>
               <p>Nor does S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s diſſembling with the Jews do any prejudice to what we have ſaid concerning the Inſpiration of the Apoſtles. We pretend not by any means to aſſert 'em infallible in their Manners; they were not exempted from human Frailties and Weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes. And it was one of S. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities to comply ſo far with the Jews, as to break off his Communication with the Gentiles. In ſo doing he gave a Proof of his Weakneſs, but we do not find that he err'd at the ſame time in point of Doctrine.</p>
               <p>We ſee that theſe two Examples have no manner of Affinity with the Inſpiration of the Sacred Writings. S. <hi>Peter</hi> doubted of the Calling of the Gentiles, but we find that Doubt rectified in the <hi>Acts.</hi> S. <hi>Peter</hi> was more indulgent in complying with the Jews than he ought to have been; but we ſee his Compliance corrected in Scripture. What Harm is all this to the Inſpiration of the Holy Writings. Were there any Weight in theſe Examples, they would be againſt <hi>Spinoſa,</hi> who admits in the Preaching of the Apoſtles an Infallibility, which he denies to be in their Writings. I ſpeak wholly and ſolely of the
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:98516:89"/>Sacred Writings; ſo that there is no neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity for me to trouble my ſelf with anſwering Objections, wherein they are not in the leaſt concern'd.</p>
               <p>However it behoves me in a few Words to ſay ſomething to what is objected againſt S. <hi>Paul,</hi> who deſirous to excuſe himſelf for having ſaid, <hi>The Lord ſhall ſtrike thee, painted wall,</hi> ſaith, <hi>That he did not know him to be the High Prieſt.</hi> We are ſomething concern'd to anſwer this Objection, becauſe S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke in that manner before a Tribunal, that is to ſay, upon ſuch an Occaſion, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt had promis'd 'em expreſly the Succour of his Spirit. Never trouble your ſelves for what you are to ſay, <hi>The Holy Ghoſt ſhall teach you, at that hour, thoſe things which you ought to ſpeak.</hi> Now being convinced, that Jeſus Chriſt is faithful in all his Promiſes, I have reaſon to believe, that the Anſwer given by S. <hi>Paul,</hi> was by the Direction of the Holy Ghoſt. Some ſay, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> declar'd, that he knew not the High Prieſt in the perſon of a violent Man, who had degraded him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by a cruel Order, and was no longer High Prieſt in the Opinion of S. <hi>Paul.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers believe, that at the time when the High Prieſthood was purchaſed with Money, the Apoſtle had reaſon to ſay, that the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon who purchas'd the Dignity, was no High Prieſt, becauſe he was not advanc'd by a lawful Ordination. But not to inſiſt upon theſe Niceties, in my Opinion there needs no more to be ſaid, but that S. <hi>Paul</hi> did not
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:98516:90"/>really know that the perſon to whom he ſpoke, was the High Prieſt. Such an Acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent might happen either through a dazling of the ſight, occaſion'd by a Tranſport of Paſſion, or becauſe it might be ſome new Face unknown to S. <hi>Paul</hi> (a thing at that time no way improbable, when the Changes of the High Prieſthood were ſo frequent) or becauſe the Crowd being very great, S. <hi>Paul</hi> could not perceive that it was the High Prieſt. It will be ſaid, perhaps, that theſe Anſwers are not ſatisfactory to juſtifie a perſon inſpired, it being certain, that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould not but perfectly know the High Prieſt. But we muſt have a ſtrange Idea of the Inſpiration of the Apoſtles to like this Objection. The Holy Ghoſt did not tell 'em all what he knew: many times he let 'em alone to ſpeak as their natural Genius prompted 'em, and in their own Idiom: and thus it was that S. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſed himſelf when he ſaid, that he knew not the High Prieſt. Could they prove, that in ſo ſaying S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpoke not what was true, there might be ſome Ground for the Objection; for ſuch an untruth is incompatible with that Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, which guided the Apoſtle in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of his Judges. Bt if he ſpoke Truth, his Anſwer no way deſtroys his Inſpiration.</p>
               <p>In the ſame Chapter they raiſe another Objection drawn from hence, that it ſeem'd to be a Sleight of human Prudence in S. <hi>Paul,</hi> to divide his Judges, by declaring that he was brought before 'em for only aſſerting the Reſurrection. Is it not certain, that the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:98516:90"/>was really one of the principal points of Religion, for which he was perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted? He depended ſo much upon that point, when he preach'd at <hi>Athens,</hi> that ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral of his Auditors cryed out, <hi>He ſeems to be a Preacher of Strange Gods,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 17.18.</note> 
                  <hi>becauſe he preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to 'em Jeſus Chriſt and the Reſurrection.</hi> In the Twenty Fifth Chapter of the Firſt to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> he reduces the whole Chriſtian Religion to the Reſurrection of one that died; I mean the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. Well there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore might this perſecuted Apoſtle be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to ſay, that he was brought before 'em for the Reſurrection. In ſo ſaying, he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted nothing but the Truth; but by ſtart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Propoſition in proper ſeaſon he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd himſelf from Perſecution, and that Peice of Dexterity look'd like an Artifice of human Prudence. Are the Saints then for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to be prudent? Quite the contrary, Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt commands 'em to be prudent and wiſe. The Foundation of the Objection is, that human Prudence and Inſpiration are incompatible. Which is evidently falſe in both ſorts of Inſpiration which I have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted. In the Inſpiration of Suggeſtion is it a thing that no way becomes the Holy Ghoſt to inſpire Men with Expedients that human Wiſdom would approve. There is no doubt to be made, but that the celebrated Expedition of <hi>Gideon</hi> was according to the Deſign which the Spirit of God revealed to him. It was preceded by a Stratagem which every Body knows; that Three hundred choſen Men took each of 'em a Trumpet,
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:98516:91"/>and a Lamp incloſed in an Earthen Pitcher. When the Signal was given, every Man ſounded his Trumpet, and brake his Pitcher: and upon that ſudden and unexpected Noiſe, and the ſight of ſo many Lights, a panick Terror ſeiz'd the <hi>Midianites.</hi> Will any one preſume to ſay, that this was not from God? Or that there was ſomething too much of human Prudence in the Stratagem? I made choice of this Example among ſeveral others: and it is ſufficient to ſhew, that it is not a thing unworthy of the Holy Ghoſt to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to thoſe whom he inſpires, Deſigns which human Prudence would allow. And this Objection is yet of leſs Force, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Inſpiration of Direction. For this ſort of Inſpiration leaving the Man to act alone in the Apoſtle, whom the Holy Ghoſt is contented to direct, 'tis no wonder, that S. <hi>Paul,</hi> tho inſpired, ſhould give us ſome Proofs of his human Prudence.</p>
               <p>It is evident by my Anſwer to theſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, that if I ſaid, that they no way con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd the Inſpiration of the Holy Writings, it was not becauſe they ſeem'd to be unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable. My Deſign in this Diſcourſe was only to defend that Inſpiration, and in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of it was not my Buſineſs to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with any thing more than the reſolving and confuting ſuch Objections as directly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe it.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>Wherein ſome Objections are Anſwered, which are directly made againſt the Sacred Books of the New Teſtament.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MY general Anſwer to theſe ſorts of Objections is, that there is not any one which injures in the leaſt the manner of my explaining the Inſpiration of the Sacred Books. Had I aſſerted that they were dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted word for word by the Holy Ghoſt, I ſhould have been troubled to anſwer ſeveral Objections; but affirming as I have done, that the greateſt part of the New Teſtament is not the Work of the Holy Ghoſt, any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than as it was written under his Directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Men, whoſe Faculties he let alone to act of themſelves, and guided them; I do not ſee that any Objection can be made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, but what muſt be built upon a ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Foundation.</p>
               <p>This has already appear'd by ſeveral Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections which I have anſwered by the by, as they offered themſelves. But now I ſhall make no ſcruple to collect together all that <hi>Spinoſa</hi> and <hi>M. N.</hi> have propos'd to counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance their Opinion. And it will be ſeen, that there needs no more than to apply my Principles, to put off theſe vain Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances.</p>
               <pb n="172" facs="tcp:98516:92"/>
               <p>'Tis ſaid, that the Apoſtles do not ſpeak good <hi>Greek;</hi> that they themſelves acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that they ſpeak upon the Credit of their Senſes; that many times they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict one another; that they make uſe of doubtful Expreſſions; and that if their Words had been inſpired, Providence would have been more careful of 'em. This in few Words is the whole that is objected againſt the Inſpiration of the Sacred Writings. If any one believes that the Holy Ghoſt ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted 'em word for word, it behoves him to conſider how to anſwer theſe Objections. For my part, I ſee not any one that bears upon the Principle which I have laid down. Let us run 'em over in few Words.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtles were not Maſters of all the Purity of the Language wherein they wrote. What harm does this do to Inſpiration, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner after which I have explain'd it. 'Tis well known, that the Holy Ghoſt could have made 'em ſpeak more exactly than they did at <hi>Athens.</hi> But he did not do it, therefore he did not aſſiſt 'em to ſpeak as they did: where's the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? They are aſſur'd, that the Apoſtles ſpoke not Foreign Languages to the heighth of Perfection. Who will from thence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that they did not learn 'em from the Holy Ghoſt? His Deſign was to facilitate the ſpreading of the Goſpel by the Miniſtry of the Apoſtles: provided they could under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how to do that, it was ſufficient. It was not his Deſign to make 'em infallible Grammarians. Their Slips in Grammar are
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:98516:92"/>but feeble Arguments againſt their Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>I am really convinc'd that the ſtyle of the Apoſtles is much better, than what they naturally had, and that that ſame degree of Perfection proceeded from the Holy Ghoſt. But though he ſhould have let them ſpeak <hi>Galilean,</hi> that could be no ground for any ſcruple againſt the inſpiration of the Sacred Writings. If their Authors, while they committed ſeveral faults againſt Grammar, wrote the truth exactly; I deſire no other advantage to ſave the Reputation of my Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem. The Holy Ghoſt it was who guided the Apoſtles in all Truth. This is ſufficient: Truth is the principal Ornament of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Writings.</p>
               <p>It were to be wiſh'd, ſay ſome, that for a farther proof of the inſpiration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Authors of the New Teſtament, they had declared that they were no more than the Secretaries of the Holy Ghoſt, and that like the ancient Prophets, they had told us, <hi>The mouth of the Lord hath ſpoken.</hi> But in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that, 'tis ſaid, that they appeal to the teſtimony of Sence; they declare that they have ſeen and heard, and that they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riv'd to the knowledge of things by good and authentic Teſtimonies I have already anſwer'd this Objection.<note place="margin">1. <hi>Pars.</hi> c. 13.</note> I ſhall ſay no more at preſent, but that it oppoſes only the Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of ſuggeſtion. We need not have any recourſe to Miracles but in caſe of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity. Now there was no neceſſity that the Holy Ghoſt ſhould ſuggeſt and dictate
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:98516:93"/>thoſe things which were already known by ordinary means, there is no more to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted than a direction, by means of which the Sacred Writers wrote exactly thoſe things which it behov'd them to write, and after ſuch a manner as they were bound to write them.</p>
               <p>They argue, they deliberate; therefore they are not inſpir'd. This is <hi>Spinoſa</hi>'s great Argument. He maintains, that there is this difference between the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets and the Apoſtles,<note place="margin">Apoſtoli namque ubique ratiocinantur, ita ut non prophet are, ſed diſputare vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deantur. Prophetae contra, mera tantum dogmata &amp; decreta continent; quia in iis Deus quaſi loquens in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducitur; qui non ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinatur, ſed ex abſoluto ſuae naturae imperio decernit. Et etiam quia Prophetae au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritas ratiocinari non pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titur, <hi>&amp;c. c. 11. l. 1.</hi> Tract. Theolog.</note> that the one never argu'd, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the VVritings of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are full of Arguments. VVhence he concludes, that by the Prophets God ſpoke like a Lord and Maſter, without debaſing himſelf to argue with his Creatures: and that the Apoſtles ſpeak like Men who ſubmit their Miniſtery to the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Hearers and their Readers.</p>
               <p>I do not believe that a more daring and raſh aſſertion could be laid down that this. It viſibly ſhews that <hi>Spinoſa</hi> was a man who car'd not what he ſaid right or wrong to ſupport his impious Concluſions. How could he be ſo bold as to affirm that God and the Prophets never argu'd with men. All the Old Teſtament is full of Proofs to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Was it not by way of reaſoning the caſe that God ſaid to <hi>Cain,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Gen.</hi> 4.6.7.</note>

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Wherefore then is thy Countenance fallen?</hi> This is certainly a Reaſoning the Caſe, if ever there were any ſuch thing, the like may be ſaid of theſe words:<note place="margin">

I think it needleſs to run over the Prophets, to ſhew that they frequently argue the Caſe. There needs no more than to open the Old Teſtament to find proofs of this aſſured truth.

                  <hi>Why ſhould ye be ſtricken any more? ye will revolt more and more.</hi> This way of arguing juſtifies God, he reſolves to take no farther care of his People: and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed all the Prophets are full of theſe Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulations.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. N.</hi> profeſſes however to believe that our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt was a Prophet, and
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:98516:94"/>a Prophet infallible. Could any man have ever read the Goſpel, and ſeriouſly maintain that ſo great a Prophet never argu'd; All his Exhortations are full of Arguments, which he ſometimes grounds upon the Old Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, ſometimes upon Natural Notions, and ſometimes upon Maxims receiv'd among the <hi>Jews.</hi> After this, to ſay that the Prophetic Spirit never argues, is either to deprive Chriſt Jeſus of the Honour which they pretend to pay him, or elſe to be ambitious of ſpeaking thoſe things which are altogether repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to truth.</p>
               <p>Quite the contrary, 'tis evident, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the manner how God, is uſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with men, that it was his pleaſure to uſe them like rational Creatures, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them by requiring their Obedience. When he produc'd the Light, which made all Bodies viſible, he never diſputed the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter but with a commanding Voice, <hi>Let there be light,</hi> ſaid He. 'Tis not the ſame thing with the light of Converſion. God makes uſe of Argument in the Creation of that new Light.</p>
               <p>This is the courſe I might have held in framing my anſwers, had I affirm'd that the Holy Spirit ſuggeſted to the Apoſtles what they wrote. But there was no need for me to enter into a diſcuſſion; for me, who aſſert that the Apoſtles were commonly no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe inſpir'd than by the way of Direction. Their Reaſon acted under the infallible Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:98516:94"/>
               <p>From thence it is apparent after what manner we ought to anſwer to what is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected concerning the dubious expreſſions which the Apoſtles make uſe of. For this is one of thoſe Objections which <hi>M. N.</hi> alledges to refute the Inſpiration of the Sacred Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of the New Teſtament. <hi>The Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts,</hi> ſays he,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> p. 2 6.</note> 
                  <hi>when they mention a certain time, never determine it exactly, becauſe they knew it not ſo preciſely, that they could fix the number of the Days and Months. We find in ſeveral places, about a certain Time, or about ſuch a Number.</hi> What is concluded from thence? <hi>That the Hiſtory was not dictated immediately by the Holy Ghoſt, who knew exactly the Number and Time that was in queſtion.</hi> This is true, and therefore I do not affirm that the Holy Ghoſt immediately dictated the Apoſtolic Hiſtory, like an Author from whoſe lips an <hi>Amanuenſis</hi> writes whatever he dictates. According to that Principle which I have laid down, the Sacred Hiſtory was written under the Direction of the Holy Ghoſt; which was no hindrance, but that the Apoſtles might ſpeak after their uſual manner. He did not acquaint them with all that he knew.</p>
               <p>There is one Objection rais'd againſt the Inſpiration of the Sacred Writers, that they often ſtumble into Contradictions. But this is more than they can ever prove. It may be eaſily ſhewn, that the one relates ſome Circumſtances which the other omits. But this is only Variety; no Contradiction: In Contradiction one of the two extreams muſt
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98516:95"/>be falſe; which is a miſcarriage that never befel any of the Apoſtles. But in Variety there is not ſo much as the ſhadow of an untruth. If two men relate the ſame ſtory, the one may forget ſome Circumſtance which may be recited by the other, and yet neither the one nor the other be guilty of Falſhood. Without queſtion Varieties of this nature are to be found in the Goſpels. If they will maintain that there are any real Contradictions in them, that is what it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves them to prove. But I have already made it out, in my Animadverſions upon the Hiſtory of <hi>Judas,</hi> that there is no ſolid ground for the moſt ſeeming Contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons that are to be found in the Goſpels.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>M. N.</hi> inſiſts upon this, that God has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted different readings in various parts of the Scripture, and they from thence alledge, that Providence would have been more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of the words, had they been inſpir'd. But do they not know, that the Prophets alſo have their various Readings, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all the Nicety, and diligent care of the Synagogue? If there be any thing which proceeded from the Mouth of God, it is his own Name. Nevertheleſs, 'tis well known that the true manner of pronouncing it is quite loſt. I know not what Opinion <hi>M. N.</hi> has of the Terms which Jeſus Chriſt makes uſe of in his Exhortations: though they were inſpi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>'d, no body will deny that ſome of them were loſt, and that thoſe which are leſt are expoſed to the variety of Reading. By which it evidently appears, that what is
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:98516:95"/>objected in reference to the Variety of Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, no way prejudices the firſt inſpiration of the Sacred Writings. Nor can we find how they ſhould be prejudic'd in the leaſt by ſaying, that God permitted the words of the Apoſtles made uſe of under the direction of the Holy Ghoſt, in proceſs of time to ſuffer ſome ſlight alteration, through the preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption or careleſneſs of the Tranſcribers. This is no hindrance but that the Apoſtles might be Infallible according to the Promiſe which Jeſus Chriſt had made them: their miſtakes would otherwiſe be a diſgrace to the Holy Ghoſt who took upon him to guide them in the Functions of their Apoſtleſhip.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, 'tis obſerved that St. <hi>Paul</hi> makes a diſtinction, between his own thought, and the expreſs direction of Jeſus Chriſt. Thus when he ſpeaks of the indiſſoluble Tie of Marriage in general,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.10.</note> 
                  <hi>But for thoſe that are marry'd, I command, yet not I, but the Lord.</hi> But when the Queſtion is about a particular Fact, upon which he gives his Opinion ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the wiſdom which God had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fus'd into him, he makes uſe of this Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, <hi>But to the reſt ſpeak I, not the Lord.</hi> Whence they conclude, that many times S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks as a wiſe Man, and that all his words are not to be look'd upon as the words of the Lord. There needs no more than to anſwer in one word, that S. <hi>Paul</hi> di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſhes between the directions which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt gave when he was upon Earth, and thoſe which he gave by the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of his Apoſtles. Jeſus Chriſt declared
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:98516:96"/>Marriage to be a Tie not to be diſſolv'd, as is apparent in the Goſpel. Afterwards upon a particular caſe among the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> Saint <hi>Paul</hi> gives his Opinion: this was the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of theſe expreſſions; <hi>I command, yet not I, but the Lord.</hi> This Diſtinction perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly agrees with the Syſtem which I have made out. It ſuppoſes, that the Apoſtles frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſpoke, argu'd, advis'd, exhorted accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own Prudence, but under the infallible Direction of the Holy Ghoſt. Thence it comes to paſs that S. <hi>Paul,</hi> after he has decided ſeveral Caſes in the Chapter whence the Objection is taken, declares, that it was by the Spirit of God that he made thoſe Revelations: <hi>And I think alſo, that I have the Spirit of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not believe that I have omitted any material Objection; but if there be any that ſlipped out, it will be an eaſie matter to reſolve it, when once the Reader becomes never ſo little the Maſter of that Principle which I think I have very clearly made out.</p>
